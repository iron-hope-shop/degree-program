        When I first started using computers, I was introduced to the Windows operating system, and ever since then, Windows is all I have ever used.

        I also used solely Windows for personal computing until I was about 19-20.  I was in college (first attempt) and my hard drive took a shock and crashed so I had to replace it... I had no money so I started using linux from a bootable USB!  I definately agree that in terms of ease of use Windows ranks toward the top.

        When it comes to operating systems on smartphones, I have tried older android devices, but in the current age of technology have only really experienced Apple phones. I believe Apple does an amazing job with their operating systems to allow us to use the phones with ease.

        I recently bought my first iPhone (iPhone SE Gen 2) because I wanted to challenge myself to use something different.  I love it.  They seem a little more optimized for transitions and heavy workloads than Android phones.
