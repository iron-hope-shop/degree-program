        When it comes to operating systems, I have used both Windows and MacOS based computers. However, I use MacOS most often and that is merely due to the fact of how convenient the MacOS works with other Mac devices. I have a few iPhones, tablets, a MacBook Pro and an iMac so they all are able to share files and work seamlessly together. I will say that the biggest downfall that I find the least appealing is the compatibility of programs with the MacOS. There are a lot of programs that I have ran across that do not work with the MacOS and that is when I have to use one of my Windows based computers if it is a program that I have to use.

        I also mainly use OSX!  I love the trackpad gestures.  I started using it at work because I got a beefy laptop.  I have a similar experience with MacOS but I use mostly web apps for personal office work anymore.  For work they have pretty much made every application we use unilaterally available across Windows and OSX.

        The difference between these and traditional computer operating systems is that there are a lot of limitations to what you are able to do or accomplish on them.

        I think this is a key takeaway and I think we should also recognize the specialized chips within these devices.  For instance, the gaming consoles have modified GPUs and the OS is built to optimize gaming and not nessicarily to... loading the nintendo store (which takes TOO LONG!).
