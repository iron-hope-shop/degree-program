    My name is Brad Jackson.  I am 25 years old and current work as a Systems Engineer II in Information Security.  I have three pets-- children-- and a beautiful wife of 2 years.  I am a mega nerd: I eat, sleep, and breathe computers.  I also listen to a lot of nerdcore.

    Of the three most common operating systems I use OSX most often.
    <b>Here is a disclaimer for all the non-believers:</b>
    I have used Windows 95 - Windows 10 (one of my work laptops is Windows 10 as well as all of my immediate family members' personal laptops which I sysadmin).  I started using Linux for my personal computing a little late (I was about 19-20), then back to Windows, and finally a 2018 MacBook Pro fell into my lap at work.  I find the gestures for the window manager is vastly superior to Windows 10 and
    <a href="https://i3wm.org/screenshots/" target="_blank">i3 on Linux</a>.  I am more productive on one screen in OSX than I am using 3 monitors with any other operating system and this has improved my development experience.  People have various reasons for "hating" Apple's products including laptops.  For example, "you can't play games on macs well!"  I do not really use my computers for gaming anymore as I mainly focus on development (Java, JS, Python, Ruby) so I guess I am their target market.  I am not trying to start a jihad I am just saying if you hate on other operating systems you should really experience them before throwing flak!

    The most basic operating system I have used is probably micropython, if that counts.  Other than that various distributions of Linux on Raspberry PIs and enterprise servers.  I began my IT journey in server operations so my then-dream of being an operating system engineer died as I realized the intricacies involved in engineering an operating system.  Servers do not really count as non-traditional but not many people who have not had field experience have applied knowledge of them.  Another non-traditional OS device I use is my Nintendo Switch.  I guess even TVs and Chromecasts have embedded chips with basic operating systems on them as well.  I hope to learn more about embedded systems and new (to me) operating systems in this course.
