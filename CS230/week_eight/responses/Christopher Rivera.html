        There will always be people who require the amount of customization that a traditional system allows, in addition to the people running enough complex computing for a continuous amount of time to make cloud based platforms less cost effective. The cost and trouble of migrating to a cloud from a traditional system is also a deterrent for some. The most compelling reason for me though is that like any other technology that we're given alternatives to, people will always continue to operate their own traditional systems for no other reason than for the strange, strange love of it. It's why I take notes on serverless architecture with a fountain pen from 1943, it's why people restore antique cars that get half a mile to a gallon of gas, and it's why even if there were absolutely NO downsides to cloud-based platforms, some people would still go through the trouble of maintaining a traditional OS. The trouble is the point.

        I strongly disagree with this.  From my experience the lack of cloud adoption is simply because a person or team is not educated enough to use the platform.  This is coupled with the retortion that "it works the way it is" despite the massive advantages of cloud architecture.  That is great if you want to set up your personal projects that way but we have a responsibility as the next generation of somputer scientists to solve problems in a more thoughtful way.
