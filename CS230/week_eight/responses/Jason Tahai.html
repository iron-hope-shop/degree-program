        I don’t think cloud-based systems make traditional operating systems obsolete, yet. Eventually I think this will occur but at this point the infrastructure can’t handle the needs of cloud-based systems to the point where the can replace traditional operating systems. Coverage and throughput would need to see significant advancement before this can become a possibility.

        I am curious what your source is when determining "coverage and throughput."  Anything sub-100ms is universally accepted as a "good enough" response time and when using a RESTful service you can achieve that on any of the aforementioned platforms.  Also, depending on your architecture (Node or Java > non-async python), you can achieve that on thousands of requests concurrently just one instance of your service running.  Scalability means that you can maintain this level of performance should you decide to increase the user base and conversely increase the service instance count.
