        Operating systems prevent unauthorized access using RBAC and permissions.  Additional layers of security are usernames and passwords for specific roles (assuming least privlidge).

        For countermeasures I would suggest having as few ports open as possible.  Firewall rules are a nessecity as well.  The text also explores time-based access.  This is an interesting method which I have experience with.  Given a team with an approved change request we (when I worked on a Server Operations team) would grant temporary access to their service account in order to execute a change.  That is a very broad way of controlling access, though, as anyone could acquire the credentials for the service account and use it for malicious purposes.

        Handling authorization needs again requires a least-privledge scenario.  We want users and processes to only have access to files that they absolutely need.

        I cannot think of another security feature that I have identified off the top of my head; however, we should never leave backdoors such as in the movie Wargames.
