        Both systems have designated units for collecting information, processing/relaying information, and  producing information. In addition, the two forms of neuron dendrites-excitatory and inhibitory-are reminiscent of the forms of binary output. Excitatory dendrites are the equivalent to "on" signals, and inhibitory dendrites are the equivalent to "off" signals.

        Great points about how human nervous systems and artificial neural networks are alike. The way you link the brain's sensory, motor, and interneurons with the input, output, and hidden layers of a computer network is fitting. Also, your comparison of "on" and "off" signals to excitatory and inhibitory dendrites is spot on.

        Human brains are better at recognizing patterns than AI, especially in regards to visual data. AI can be easily fooled by biased data, or unrelated noise, or insignificant changes that humans may not even notice. It is my theory that this is because humans learn from a young age to process two-dimensional images from their eyes as a three-dimensional space. Because we are always moving and looking at our surroundings, we quickly learn to extrapolate data that is just out of our line of sight, and we recognize objects not as still images with set surroundings from a specific angle, but as three-dimensional geometry. But while humans will have the equivalent of years of video of the same objects from different angles in different lighting, AI only has a relatively smaller set of data with which to form patters. In short, humans see 2-d images as 3-d, while AI does not.

        I really like your idea about humans being better at spotting patterns, especially with pictures. I agree that being able to think about flat images as 3-D objects gives us an advantage. And you're right, AI doesn't have as much to go on as humans do when it comes to learning from experience.

        My own thoughts focus more on how different these systems are. Even though they have some things in common, real brains are way more complex and flexible than artificial ones.
