        Really enjoyed reading your post on neural networks. Your analogy comparing them to our brains was spot on. The idea of neurons forming complex networks and relaying messages all over our bodies is pretty much exactly what these AI systems are trying to mimic. It's like we're trying to teach machines to think like us, even if it's in a really simplified way.

        There are essentially three different types of machine learning besides deep learning, including supervised learning where the machine is presented with input data as well as desired output, unsupervised learning where the machine is only presented with input data, leaving it up to the machine to find something meaningful by itself, and reinforcement learning where the machine learns through trial and error using feedback from its actions and generating rewards or punishments

        Your breakdown of machine learning types hit the nail on the head. The way you explained supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning makes it easy to understand. It's like you're saying machines are like students in different types of learning environments: some need a lot of guidance (supervised learning), some learn by exploring on their own (unsupervised learning), and some learn best from their mistakes (reinforcement learning).

        Machines can only solve new problems as their intelligence is updated and trained through data acquired, while humans are able to sustain their intelligence and continually expand their knowledge through many different methods.

        I totally agree with your point about machines needing updates or new data to solve new problems. We humans have a leg up here. We learn and adapt from all our experiences, not just the ones that are fed to us. Plus, we can learn in so many different ways - from books, teachers, the internet, our own trial and error, and even from each other in this class.

        Your thoughts have got me thinking about how we can use this knowledge to improve AI systems in the future. Really looking forward to more great insights from you as this course goes on!
