<p style="text-indent: 48px; line-height: 2;">Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and biological neural networks, although
    conceptually parallel in certain respects, demonstrate considerable differences in their function and structure.
    Both can be considered as systems of interconnected nodes (or "neurons") that process information by modifying their
    internal states in response to inputs (Zador, 2019). It's crucial to understand, though, that biological neurons'
    complex operations are far more intricate than those in ANNs. <!-- UPDATE --></p>
<p style="text-indent: 48px; line-height: 2;">In the context of biological neurons, input is received and processed,
    which, when exceeding a specific threshold, leads to the neuron 'firing' and passing on a signal to other neurons.
    This communication is facilitated through complex electrochemical signals, encompassing a combination of excitatory
    and inhibitory effects. <!-- UPDATE --></p>
<p style="text-indent: 48px; line-height: 2;">Artificial neurons in ANNs, however, work in a different manner. They
    receive numerical input data, perform a basic calculation (like a weighted sum), and then apply a typically
    nonlinear function (the activation function) to determine their output. Unlike biological synapses that can
    strengthen or weaken over time, the connection strengths or 'weights' in ANNs are largely deterministic.
    <!-- UPDATE --></p>
<p style="text-indent: 48px; line-height: 2;">On a network level, ANNs typically have a static architecture with
    'layers' of neurons. Learning within these networks is achieved through the adjustment of connection weights based
    on the errors made by the network. In contrast, biological neural networks are dynamic and plastic, adapting their
    connections and intrinsic properties in a complex manner to learn and evolve.&nbsp;<!-- UPDATE --></p>
<p style="text-indent: 48px; line-height: 2;">When it comes to learning, humans and machines follow quite different
    paths. Humans learn from experiences, comprehending context, understanding abstract concepts, and applying prior
    knowledge to new situations. This learning process involves not only pattern recognition but also the ability to
    understand, conceptualize, and generalize. <!-- UPDATE --></p>
<p style="text-indent: 48px; line-height: 2;">On the other hand, machine learning, which is the learning mechanism for
    ANNs, primarily relies on pattern recognition within the input data. ANNs are trained on a large volume of data,
    with their learning capability limited to identifying patterns and correlations within that data. While ANNs can
    extrapolate and make predictions based on the learned patterns, they lack the ability to understand context or apply
    conceptual knowledge, which is a distinctive characteristic of human learning (Marcus, 2018). <!-- UPDATE --></p>
