When a human being is faced with solving the given 8x8 maze, they would typically start by observing the entire maze and planning a path towards the treasure. They would rely on intuition, memory, and trial and error to navigate through free and occupied cells. On the other hand, the intelligent agent, representing the pirate, uses deep Q-learning to solve the problem. It initializes Q-values, explores new paths, and learns from rewards and penalties to find the optimal path. The agent's learning is systematic and data-driven, leveraging the computational power of algorithms, whereas humans rely more on instinct and experience.

The intelligent agent's purpose in pathfinding is to efficiently navigate the maze to reach the treasure. It balances exploration, where it takes random actions to discover new paths, with exploitation, where it uses known information to move towards the goal. The optimal balance between these two depends on the training stage and the complexity of the maze. Reinforcement learning, implemented through deep Q-learning, systematically guides the agent towards the treasure by adapting to the environment and refining the pathfinding strategy.

For this specific game, deep Q-learning was implemented using neural networks. The neural network's architecture was designed to approximate the Q-function, representing expected cumulative rewards for actions in different states. Training data consisted of experiences collected during gameplay, and the network was trained to minimize the difference between predicted and target Q-values. Action selection was guided by the Q-values, and continuous learning allowed the agent to adapt over time. This implementation effectively combined the power of neural networks with reinforcement learning to handle the complex 8x8 maze pathfinding problem.
