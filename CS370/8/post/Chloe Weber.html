        Your focus on the challenges of coding and the potential role of AI assistants like ChatGPT is timely. I agree with your revised stance on not relying solely on ChatGPT's outputs, given the ethical concerns you've highlighted. Your idea of reverse-engineering text from ChatGPT is innovative. However, determining the intent behind a piece of code can be intricate. An alternative might be to incorporate an authentication system within AI coding assistants, ensuring accountability. Additionally, specialized plagiarism detection tools for code could be employed by educational institutions to ensure originality. In essence, while AI can aid coding, a balance between automation and human oversight is crucial. Your post underscores this balance effectively.
