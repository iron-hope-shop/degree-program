        My name is Brad Jackson and I am a 28-year-old cybersecurity professional. For the past three years, I have been actively working on various machine learning projects, absorbing every facet of this exciting field. Outside of my professional life, I am the proud father of four amazing children and the husband to a wonderful wife. As a self-professed mega nerd, my passion for computers seeps into almost every aspect of my life. In my free time, I can be found enjoying nerdcore music or reading up on the latest in tech and artificial intelligence.

        Though I'm already working professionally, I firmly believe that there's always more to learn, especially in a field as dynamic and rapidly advancing as computer science. I hope that by furthering my understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, I will be able to contribute more effectively to my field, while also opening new avenues for personal and career growth.

        An apt example of an intelligent system is an autonomous vehicle. These vehicles leverage a variety of technologies such as Lidar, radar sensors, computer vision, GPS, and intricate mapping to navigate their environment. They need to predict and react to unpredictable elements like pedestrians, other drivers, and changing weather conditions. Autonomous vehicles learn from every situation they encounter, improving their performance over time. They are considered intelligent systems because they can comprehend, learn from, predict, and adapt to their environment to meet their objectives.

        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "intelligent". Machine Learning (ML), on the other hand, is a specific subset of AI that involves giving machines access to data and allowing them to learn for themselves. In simpler terms, AI is the objective, and ML is one of the pathways to achieve that objective. AI can be rule-based and doesn't necessarily have to learn anything, while ML, by contrast, learns patterns from data and incrementally improves its predictions over time.

        What excites me most about this course is the prospect of further exploring AI and ML alongside all of you. I'm looking forward to engaging in thought-provoking discussions and collaborative problem-solving exercises that will aid our comprehension of these complex fields. I'm also eager to deepen my knowledge about state-of-the-art techniques, frameworks, and tools in AI and ML, and to better understand their real-world applications.
