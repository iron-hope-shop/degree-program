        It's great to meet you! Firstly, congratulations on the upcoming arrival of your first child! That's indeed a joyous occasion, and I sincerely hope everything goes smoothly for you and your family.

        For my example of an intelligent system I have chosen to talk about the rumba. this little vacuum is considered an intelligent system for a couple of reasons. One is they are able to respond to the environment around them and navigate around your home. Another reason would be some are able to actually map your house while they are vacuuming so that the next time the vacuum they have improved speed because they remember when and where they bumped into to something and had to turn.

        I like the example you provided of an intelligent system. Roombas are certainly a prevalent household example of how smart technology can make our lives more convenient. The way they map and remember the layout of a house to improve their efficiency is a fantastic demonstration of machine learning in action.

        Your point on the differences between AI and machine learning is very well-articulated. I completely agree that AI refers to machines exhibiting a level of human-like intelligence, while machine learning is a specific approach to achieve AI, which revolves around the machine learning from data.

        Like you, I'm also excited about learning more about AI, particularly how it integrates with our day-to-day lives. I believe it will be interesting to delve into the depths of AI and machine learning and understand how these technologies mimic, and sometimes exceed, human intelligence in certain tasks.

        Best of luck to you, especially with the imminent arrival of your newborn!
