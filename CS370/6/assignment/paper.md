Reinforcement learning (RL) is a dynamic field that offers various approaches to solving complex problems. One such problem is the cartpole, an unstable system that requires precise control to balance a pole on a moving cart. This paper explores two advanced RL concepts, the REINFORCE algorithm and the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) method, and their application to the cartpole problem. Additionally, the differences between policy gradient, value-based, and actor-critic approaches are discussed.

The REINFORCE algorithm is a Monte-Carlo variant of policy gradients that updates the policy parameter through random sampling. It involves performing a trajectory roll-out using the current policy, storing log probabilities and rewards at each step, calculating discounted cumulative future rewards, computing the policy gradient, and updating the policy parameter (Yoon, n.d.). The process is repeated until the agent learns to balance the pole for a longer duration.

In the context of the cartpole problem, REINFORCE can be effectively applied by setting up a policy network and an update function. The discounted reward is normalized to provide stability in training, and the agent's performance is evaluated over multiple training episodes. The results demonstrate that the agent learns to balance the pole for an extended time, validating the efficacy of the REINFORCE algorithm in solving the cartpole problem.

The Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) method is a variant of the Actor-Critic architecture that focuses on the advantage value, representing how much better a specific action is compared to the average action at a given state (Yoon, n.d.). In A2C, the "Critic" estimates the value function, either the action-value (Q value) or state-value (V value), while the "Actor" updates the policy distribution based on the Critic's suggestions.

Applying A2C to the cartpole problem involves utilizing the Actor-Critic architecture, where the Actor makes decisions about actions, and the Critic evaluates those actions. By iteratively updating both the Critic network and the Value network, the system learns to balance the cartpole. A2C's efficiency and comparable performance to its asynchronous counterpart, A3C, make it a suitable choice for this problem.

Policy gradient approaches, like REINFORCE, directly optimize the policy by adjusting the probabilities of taking certain actions. They can suffer from high variance, leading to unstable learning. In contrast, value-based approaches focus on estimating the value of actions and then selecting the best one, aiming to reduce variance.

Actor-Critic methods combine both value and policy-based approaches. The Critic estimates the value function, and the Actor updates the policy based on the Critic's evaluation. This dual approach leverages the strengths of both value and policy-based methods, providing a more robust solution to problems like the cartpole.

The exploration of the REINFORCE and A2C algorithms in the context of the cartpole problem offers valuable insights into advanced reinforcement learning concepts. The successful application of these methods demonstrates their potential in solving complex computing problems. Understanding the differences between policy gradient, value-based, and actor-critic approaches further enriches the comprehension of reinforcement learning paradigms.
