        It's a smart move to pick chess, it's one of those games where strategy is everything, so it fits well with the reinforcement learning concept.

        Your four states-- start, play, rest, and end-- cover the flow of a chess game nicely. One thing to think about is, would it be helpful to break down the 'play' state a little more? Like, maybe considering different stages of the game (opening, mid-game, end-game) could help the agent make more strategic moves.

        The rewards and penalties you've outlined make sense --  a trophy for winning and a loss of one for losing. But how about including some rewards or penalties for smaller achievements or mistakes within the game? For example, capturing the opponent's queen could be a big reward, while losing a key piece might earn a penalty. This way, the agent learns from both its victories and its losses.

        The comparison you made to the MDP is well-explained. You're absolutely right that chess isn't random, and each move can have a big impact. Your point about how practice leads to improved performance perfectly encapsulates the reinforcement learning principle!

        Good job on your post, Adam! It's clear you've thought this through and applied the reinforcement learning concepts well. Keep up the good work!
