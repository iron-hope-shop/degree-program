        Choosing chess as a game for reinforcement learning is a great choice indeed! It's a game of strategy where every move can drastically change the outcome. Your explanation of how the game ends—either through checkmate or resignation—is spot on. Also, I like how you pointed out the importance of taking opponent's pieces to limit their ability to attack or defend.

        Your comparison between chess and Markov Decision Process (MDP) is quite thoughtful. You're right that a chess move can have a range of impacts and that it involves a mix of deterministic and stochastic elements; however, when it comes to the notion of a Markov process being "memory-less", it refers to the property that the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In that sense, each move in chess can be viewed as a Markov process - the decision of the next move depends only on the current configuration of the board, not the specific sequence of moves that led to it. But it's worth noting that a good chess player remembers past moves to understand the opponent's strategy, which might seem to contradict the memory-less property.

        Lastly, you might think about diving deeper into how reinforcement learning could manifest in chess, perhaps by outlining states, rewards, and rules for an AI player - this could lend even more depth to your already compelling analysis.

        Your application of reinforcement learning to chess was insightful and provided a great perspective on the game's complexity!
