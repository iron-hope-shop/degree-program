        This makes sense the way I understand contrapositive and contradictive proofs.  I wrote that a proof by contradiction assumes the theorem is false and tries to show inconsistency; meanwhile, a proof by contrapositive assumes the conclusion is false and proves the negation of the hypothesis.  A proof by contradiction could not be applied to your example because it would be fallacious.
