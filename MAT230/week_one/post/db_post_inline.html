    My name is Brad Jackson.  I am 26 years old and currently work as a Systems Engineer II in Information Security.  I am also enrolled in the computer science program (BS).  I have three children and a beautiful wife of 2 years.  I am a mega nerd: I eat, sleep, and breathe computers.  I also listen to a lot of nerdcore music.  I am excited to learn more about discrete mathematics and apply it to my job/life!  I have not been in a math class for a few semesters so it should be a challenge to get used to.

    Fundamentally, I think that everyday logic and mathematical logic can both be boiled down to structures and statements.  Decision making is a big part of every day life from the minutiae to the plenteous.  Being able to quickly identify the logical flow of a situation in order to make decisions can help in situations where time is critical.
