        I believe that the difference between everyday logic and mathematical logic is that there is mathematical proof. I am hoping that by studying mathematical logic, it may help me apply similar concepts to everyday logic.

        I wish we had proofs incorporated into our everyday conversation or at least that people thought more logically.  I think people would understand eachother a lot more easily!  I have interacted with some confusing customers.  It reminds me of horrible drivers-- what can we do to stop them?!  Proofs: think it through.
