        So far in the module, I have not reached any difficulties however I've only reached halfway and still have the problem set to do so I might add on to the discussion if I need help.

        It certainly is a lot to take in!  I think I am pretty behind just because this class is a little more demanding than others so I am having to rethink my schedule.  The last class I had like this was CS210 where we had the interactive C++ activities.  I wonder if there is a time management class... if so, I probably need to take it. :P
