# As the culture shift happens, communicate with your team members to discuss the practices and aspects of agile you feel are important to incorporate into your team. 

# If there are any practices you feel should not be incorporated, provide an argument to your team as to why they should not be included. 

- Focus on your specific role and how the practices will help you be more effective in your job. 
- Ask your team members clarifying questions about their suggestions. 
- Direct your communication to specific team roles as needed.
- Provide clear feedback to your classmates when they ask questions of your role, and clear feedback about the practices you want to implement. 
- Work together as a team to accept and adopt at least one practice submitted by each team member.

Matthew and Team,

As I am the Product Owner, of course I will always be present when/where needed!  That goes for all stakeholders as well.  Our customers are free to schedule impromptu meetings for their voice to be heard.  I will represent their voice in our planning meetings and make sure the product is conforming to their vision. You are all also free to schedule meetings with me in order to communicate to the customer!  Additionally, I will order the backlog by priority, risk, value, learning opportunities, and dependencies.  By considering these and balancing these aspects of our work I believe we will achieve agile greatness.
