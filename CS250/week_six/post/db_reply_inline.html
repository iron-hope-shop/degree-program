        As I am the Product Owner, of course I will always be present when/where needed!  That goes for all stakeholders as well.  Our customers are free to schedule impromptu meetings for their voice to be heard.  I will represent their voice in our planning meetings and make sure the product is conforming to their vision. You are all also free to schedule meetings with me in order to communicate to the customer!  Additionally, I will order the backlog by priority, risk, value, learning opportunities, and dependencies.  By considering these and balancing these aspects of our work I believe we will achieve agile greatness.
