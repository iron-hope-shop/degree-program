    Story points are an estimation practice which has both pros and cons.  One of the pros is that you can block a specific amount of time out of your work week for a specific task.  You usually base story points off of the Fibonacci sequence.  One of the downsides is that there can be a lot fo speculation on how many story points encompass a certain amount of time.  For instance, two companies might use the Fibonacci sequence but 3 story points could mean something drastically different between the two.  Another downside is that your story point estimate is just that-- an estimate. You could create a story for "researching xyz" and find it over as soon as it began.  From my experience it is beneficial for you to under-estimate the story points required for tasks you are unsure about.

    I have had a few experiences incorrectly estimating story points in my current role.  The theories in this book are great but unfortunately I find myself in a sort of dev-ops environment so they do not follow the agile method with prescision.  This means that I am on my own in terms of story estimation nearly all of the time.  It would be helpful to approach another team to help me.  Using the planning poker method I could probably get a better estimate for those tricky-to-estimate stories.
