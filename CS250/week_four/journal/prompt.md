# What elements of the user stories were the most helpful in developing your initial test cases?
The acceptance criteria and story name were the most helpful elements of the user stories during the development of my initial test cases.  To know the desired result and the requirements was practically all the test cases were.  This reflected the needs of the end user's requirements.

# What was missing from the user stories that would have been helpful?
There was not necessarily anything missing from the user stories that would have been helpful; however,  there were few details about the actual application that we were shown.  Sure we got the list of images and titles of travel packages, and then a revised version of the app.  We should have been given an overview of the application during the initial presentation/meeting with the product owner.

# How might you go about getting this additional information?
In reality, the first thing I would do before I felt confident accepting stories would be to research and familiarize myself with the applications.

# Create a sample email that would effectively relate your needs and prompt a proper response. Be sure to identify the recipient of the communication and the specific information you expect to receive.
Here is my email draft, directed toward the product owner, product manager, and my development team (cc'd).

Team,

  I am unfamiliar with this application and would like to get a local development environment set up before our first product meeting.  Is there an internal repository I could clone, or who would be able to assist me with standing this up?

Thank you,
Brad Jackson
