        Principle #3 - Iterative Sprint Methods ... This is how Amazon is able to ensure that the customer is getting the best service possible since Amazon allows its users to provide feedback constantly and about everything.

        From the alignment matrix chart I choose minimize wasted effort, duplication, and resources; however, I agree that iterative sprint methods are important to Amazon's approach.  Being able to rapidly evolve as a company is a large part of what has made Amazon successful.  Coupled with the fact that they are trying to reduce tech debt, this will keep the company lean and truly agile in the future!

        Principle #4 - Effective Cross-Functional Collaboration: This principle essentially highlights the importance of teamwork and successful collaboration that includes input from the customer as well.

        We chose the same principle to apply to our SNHU Travel Project.  I think that really engaging our customer and product team at a personal level and believing in the product is the foundation of cross-functional collab oration.  And I suggested that we take a Kaizen-like approach to this, pledging to use the application to plan our next vacations.
