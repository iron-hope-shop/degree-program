        From the alignment matrix, I chose “4. Effective cross-functional collaboration with a clear intent is supported.”  I found the story of Jeff Bezos’ dropped box to be a perfect example of effective cross-functional collaboration.

        We chose completely different, yet synergetic, principles.  I thought that the minization of tech debt and efficiency were the most important principle that Amazon could follow but I see from your explaination that there would be nothing to streamline if nobody liked the product.

        For the SNHU Travel project, I would apply the agile principle “8.                Support relentless and sustainable innovation and progress. Change is constant, and the pace never slows.”

        I agree with this sentiment but in a twist of irony I chose "Effective cross-functional collaboration" for this prompt.  I felt as though this encouraged us, as a team, to really get behind the product we are working on.  Not just to improve it but to believe in it.
