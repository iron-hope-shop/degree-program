Throughout this course, you and your peers will create a community where you can ask each other questions, share ideas, and build your skills together. In your initial post for this discussion, introduce yourself to your peers and discuss your career aspirations. Then, address each of the following:

# Based on your existing experience in the SNHU Computer Science program, work experience, or ideas from the module readings, what issues are present with the waterfall development model?
Based on my existing experience in the SNHU Computer Science program there is at least one major issue present with the waterfall development model.  The main issues is the rigidity: the waterfall methodology seems to be set in stone whereas the very nature of agile is to pivot based on business needs.  Unfortunately, I have not had any buisness experience with this methodology.  It was phased out by our project planning teams and replaced with agile shortly before I started working on projects.

# How do you see the agile methodology resolving these issues?
Agile is an ongoing process which is very susceptible to change.  In my opinion, it is more of a template for moving forward than a concrete plan.  This is in line with most modern continuous integration and continuous delivery ideals.  Personally, I like the power of being able to change the direction of a project right away rather than having to chuck it in the backlog as an enhancement.

# What aspects of the agile methodology will impact those issues the most?

# In your responses to your classmates, address the following:

# What other effects do you think the stated aspects will have on the software development life cycle?
