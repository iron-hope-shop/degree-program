    Based on my existing experience in the SNHU Computer Science program there is at least one major issue present with the waterfall development model.  The main issues is the rigidity: the waterfall methodology seems to be set in stone whereas the very nature of agile is to pivot based on business needs.  Unfortunately, I have not had any buisness experience with this methodology.  It was phased out by our project planning teams and replaced with agile shortly before I started working on projects.

    Agile is an ongoing process which is very susceptible to change.  In my opinion, it is more of a template for moving forward than a concrete plan.  This is in line with most modern continuous integration and continuous delivery ideals.  Personally, I like the power of being able to change the direction of a project right away rather than having to chuck it in the backlog as an enhancement.
