        The valpak solution consisted of things such as training their stakeholders into things such as kanban, agile, and scrum. I thought that was a very interesting way to manage their stakeholders and also kind of show their stakeholders just what part of their job as developers consists of. Also they also began regular stakeholder meetings which is good for helping with understanding how the company is doing and what it is doing.

        This is a great idea for getting (and keeping) stakeholders involved if they are truly interested in doing that.  This would certainly not work in a waterfall approach because the expectation for stakeholders is that they are involved only in the beginning and ending of the process.
