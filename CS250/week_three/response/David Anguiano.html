        Accountability at the Top was a problem Valpak faced. Since their agile teams were in place before portfolio Kanban, the teams had their own flow and leaders which created a disconnect in the business. The solution they provided for this problem was establishing Leaders to represent each team at the Executive level.

        Accountability is not something that holds a different meaning when transitioning between waterfall and agile methodologies; therefore, I think Valpak could have used a waterfall approach to meet these challenges.  One of the core characteristics of the waterfall methodology is fixed scope versus estimated scope in agile.  So from that perspective there are fundamentally clearer scopes and accountabilities.
