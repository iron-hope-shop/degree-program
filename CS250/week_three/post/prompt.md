# Identify the challenge you picked and briefly describe the actions Valpak took to overcome this challenge.
Valpak had the challenge of product adoption among its franchises.  Valpak increased its effort in educating the franchises on how to work with the products and their value propositions.

# How do these actions show an agile-based approach?
These actions show an agile-based approach because they are embracing the fundamental values of the agile methodology: incremental changes.  Valpak collaborated with the customers of its product, their own franchises, in order to give them hands-on experience to enable change.

# If you encountered a similar challenge when developing a piece of software, what approach would you take?
It is almost daily that I encounter problems with product adoption (it is usually me who is the customer facing the challenge of adopting a product).  It is not easy to be a guinea pig nor a pioneer but it is most certainly work it for the company as a whole for someone to pick up the gauntlet when new software is introduced within the environment.  It is for this reason that I lean toward being reasonable/adaptable when met with change.  It is also important to communicate with the team which is offering the product or service in order to iron out as many issues as possible with the initial product adoption.  It is for the benefit of everyone.
