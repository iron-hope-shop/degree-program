# How does scaling a company or program help in the release planning and the amount of work that can be released to the customer?
One way that scaling a program helps in release planning and amount of work that can be released to the customer is more developers.  Having more developers per scrum master/product owner means new features and bug fixes on any one project can be implemented more quickly.  This also means that the domain of the product will be more comprehensive, establsihing a better sense of value for the customer.  Additionally it encourages the product to diversify integrations.

# Which of the scaling frameworks (Scrum@Scale, LeSS, SAFe, or Nexus) do you think would work best for helping a company to scale? Why?
If I were going to chose a scaling framework for a company, I would go with SAFe because it offers different tiers of integration.  For instance, you could go with just the essentials, embrace SAFe in all its glory, or somewhere in between.  SAFe even offers mini-business plans for startups!  In all honesty I think that these scaling frameworks are all very similar and any of them will provide you the guide rails for getting started/moving forward.  I would go SAFe, build good teams, and have a shared vision.  It would also not be extremely difficult to switch from one to another since they are scrum-based.
