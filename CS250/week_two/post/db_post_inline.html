        I have chosen to speak from the perspective of the development team.  The trai identified in the paper which I think is most important is the pursuit of excellence.  I think continuous improvement should not only apply to deliverables but also to our personal working practices.  For instance, I currently work in security and I would be remiss to ignore the latest security flaws.  This is especially true if they apply to the projects I am working on!

        The trait which I find most relatable, though, is "Don't need a sprint 0."  Every quarter I watch teammates slack on planning for sprint 0, basically taking the week to plan and recuperate which I think is such a waste of time!

        There is another trait which is defined within the article but not within the scope of the development team and that is: mentor/be both dispensable and wanted.  I think it is important to realize that everyone is replaceable and sometimes the most profound thing you can do is positively influence those around you, encouraging them to do their best, and try your best.  This includes keeping up with the bleeding-edge news in your field in order to spread the world about new technologies so that your company or group does not stagnate.
