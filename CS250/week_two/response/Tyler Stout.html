        Part of the success of a SCRUM team is that the development team is self-organized.  When this happens, the SCRUM master should step back and let it run as a mere advisor when questions arise.

        The SCRUM master should definitely facilitate team members' managing of their own tasks.  On the other hand, if a team member/developer needs to ask the SCRUM master for help, the SCRUM master should make themselves available.  Their role is that of a catalyst and "micromanaging," as you say, is detrimental to productivity.
