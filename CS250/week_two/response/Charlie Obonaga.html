        I think a trait like excellent communication skills would also be a good fit for a product owner. This trait is not defined in the article but communication skills is a must for a product owner who has to interact with all sorts of people at different levels. Knowing how to communicate with shareholders is a good skill but it wont be as useful if you apply the same method to a development team. Its important to have that flexibility in communication to make sure everything in your project is running smoothly.

        From my experience, sometimes it is difficult to understand "the ask" from the customer.  This is especially important during planning.  Unfortunately, customers do not always convey their ask in a way that makes sense to an engineer.  For this reason I tend to agree with your statement that knowing how to communicate with stakeholders is a good skill to have; furthermore, I would say it is a requirement for success, good call!
