        You've done a solid job breaking down the pros and cons of S3 and local disk storage. I agree that S3's scalability and availability are huge benefits, especially compared to the fixed capacity of local storage. On the other hand, local storage can be faster for data access since it's not reliant on network speed, and the cost after the initial purchase is minimal. The flexibility of S3's storage classes and the ability to automate file movement is a game-changer, though. It's all about finding the right balance for specific needs, right?
