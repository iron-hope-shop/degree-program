        In the depths of the Amazon jungle, every creature adapts to survive the ever-changing environment. Businesses must also adapt their data storage strategies to thrive in the digital jungle. With what tool, you ask? It's Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        S3 offers an object storage service wherein a storage "bucket" is created along with a service account and other tools to access the S3 instance. Local storage is quicker and easier to access but default configs and poor pen testing open these vectors for cyber attacks. EC2 allows admins to create accounts and access management features to mitigate security risk. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        When comparing Amazon S3 and local disk storage, we find key differences in data access, size, cost, and safety. Each storage type has strengths and limits that affect how companies handle and save their data. Using cloud storage like S3 means your data storage can grow or shrink as needed versus traditional physical hard drives, which need to be replaced to increase their capacity. This means you don't have to pay for a whole datacenter, rack, or server, it's all abstracted away by Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        Access to data is vital in comparing Amazon S3 with local disk storage. Amazon S3 lets you securely access data from anywhere on the internet with minimal configuration and maximuzed security. This enables faster development due to accessibility and the ability to create multiple environments for production and development. Which in turn allows users to have a seamless experience when interacting with your application.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        Amazon S3 uses a pay-what-you-use model, which can lower costs. Local disk storage requires buying hardware upfront. It also has ongoing upkeep costs, which might be higher over time. Amazon S3's costs are low, and uptime is pretty high. Using S3, objects are automatically stored across multiple devices spanning a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs). But as you know, nothing is 100% uptime. I remember getting a call that Microsoft's south-central datacenter was struck by lightning. Most of our company's apps were failed over to clusters in other datacenters but you can imagine the chaos regardless.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        Amazon S3 offers different storage classes. These classes meet various needs and budgets. Users can pick the best option for their data, making their storage plan more efficient and helps choose the best class for cost and speed. Bucket storage pricing is usually based around how warm the data is. If the data moves around constantly, it is "warm" likewise if the data is rarely accessed it is "cold." Cold storage offers a way cheaper rate as there are no moving parts, no compute-intensive transactions bothering it all day.
