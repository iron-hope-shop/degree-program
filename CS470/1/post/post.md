it's crucial to highlight the benefits of using containers for consistent software environments and easy deployment across different systems, as mentioned in the course materials​​. You might discuss containers’ ability to streamline development and ensure that software runs the same way on all systems without the need to replicate the host environment. Also, consider the downsides, such as potential security issues if not managed properly and the overhead of managing multiple containers. Mention specific scenarios where containerization is advantageous over traditional virtual machines, like in microservices architecture where each service can be deployed independently in its container​​.
