        IAM roles and policies are essential for securing access to AWS resources. IAM roles act as identities for
        services and users, granting them temporary security credentials. These roles can be linked to IAM policies,
        which are JSON documents outlining what actions are allowed or denied. By creating unique IAM roles and policies
        for each service, you can implement least privilege and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        IAM policies come in two main types: identity-based and resource-based. Identity-based policies are attached to
        users, groups, and roles, defining their permissions. Resource-based policies are attached to resources like S3
        buckets, controlling who can access them. Additionally, IAM offers broader access control mechanisms like
        permission boundaries and SCPs to further enhance security.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        Effectively using IAM roles and policies ensures secure access management in your AWS environment. By creating
        unique roles with specific permissions and attaching them to services, you can minimize risks and maintain
        control over your cloud resources.
