        I found the discussion on the benefits of serverless architecture particularly interesting, especially the explanation of scalability and cost efficiency in cloud solutions. The presentation effectively communicated the concept of serverless solutions by comparing it to familiar local storage, making it accessible to non-technical audiences. For example, the analogy of cloud storage to a folder on a PC, where more space can be added with a simple click, was clear and relatable. Additionally, the explanation of roles and policies using real-world examples helped demystify complex security concepts. Well done!
