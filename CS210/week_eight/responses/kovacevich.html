        What would you do if someone asked you to write a program that makes a motor spin faster, or maybe a program that changes GPS coordinates for some harmless little prank?

        Above I wrote "It is impossible to create sensitive, widely-used, tools which cannot be used by SOMEONE for malicious intent."  Let me make an amendment, it is unavoidable that a malicious purpose cannot be realized from even the simplest applications.  Knowing this we have to use our best judgement when creating tools which could be harnessed to stop someone's artificial heart or drive their Tesla into a tree.  In cases where sensitive systems are involved I believe the best mitigation is not only our judgement but nessicary security protocols.  For example, this code would probably be internal IP and even the source code would require role-based access to view.  Questioning the purpose for the code is a must and that is part of initial planning and I do not assume to know every possible effect of writing a given piece of code.
