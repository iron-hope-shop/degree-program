        Based on the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (See reference link below), section 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.  â€“ How would you explain why this is important to Programmers?

        This is important to programmers because "a system for which future risks cannot be reliably predicted requires frequent reassessment of risk as the system evolves in use, or it should not be deployed" otherwise there may be risk involved (ACM, 2018). If a project involves sensitive data then it is crucial to make sure the data is secure when it is at rest and in transit.  Security and compliance reviews help make up for the fact that this is sometimes overlooked by developers.
