      Below are, what I deem to be, the biggest advantages and disadvantages of the languages we have studied.

        I would select a language based on maintainability and delivery date.  For example, if I was charged with creating a small (max of a few hundred requests/second) RESTful service before the end of the day I would choose Python.  This is because I believe I could create the most wholly completed product within the timeframe; additionally, not many people I work with know C++.
      <!-- UPDATE -->
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        If I were creating an enterprise-scale REST service and had 2 weeks I would use Java.  That is because I feel Java is a little more robust when it comes to serving thousands of requests per second while not using too much processing capacity.  More people I know use Java than C++ (zero people I know use C++).  When I no longer maintained the project there would be a learning curve but it would not be as steep as it would with C++ (and most of the enhancements would probably be derivative).

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        I may use Python for the frontend when creating a dynamic website, partly because I hate using JSP but mainly because it would be easy to do.  Meanwhile, the backend processing/ETL would be handled by a more efficient language such as Java/C++ thus reducing overall latency.
      <!-- UPDATE -->

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        Contrary to my initial thoughts, I now believe C++ would be the least secure language as there is a lot more to manage; however, if you have infinite time and plan accordingly using modern protocols, these languages are equally secure.
