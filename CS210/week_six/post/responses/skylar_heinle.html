        When looking at which programs I would choose over others, I would weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each programming language. While Java and PHP may be easier for web development, C++ could function better for a program that needs the speed of the compiler or manual memory management.

        I agree that using a variety of languages would be advantagous when building a application.  I think the whole point of this mental exercise is to encourage us not to create bad-code-smell-monolithic applications.  Security is going to be the hardest part of integrating all of your stack together but as long as you are using current protocols and have a firewall between your backend and database you are probably doing well.  Apart from that, the hardest thing will be to comment EVERYTHING so that the next engineer knows why you employed several languages in a readable way.
