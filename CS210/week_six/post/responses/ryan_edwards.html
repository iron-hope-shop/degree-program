        For deciding which to use, it mostly comes down to what is being programmed, such as using C++ and Java for creating and managing an operating system while using python for a more friendly user application.

        Agreed that Python is probably a good choice for the frontend but I am still waiting for the day I never have to use CSS again!

        I would also say in regards to using multiple languages that C++ and Java do go well together, as Java could be used to update an older C++ made program.

        I believe we can also extend Python with C++ although I do not have a ton of experience with that.  I have not read ahead but I hope this is covered in the text or supplemental readings.
