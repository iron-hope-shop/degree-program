        ... what did you find to be the most interesting about the Typing Strategies of the Java programming language?

        The advantages and disadvantages of Java being a strongly static typed language were all interesting to read about.  Something that stands out to me was the comment that "One of the major disadvantage in having a strict static typed language is that we would end up in having so
        much “boiler-plate” code that doesn’t contribute anything significant to the logic of the code" (Alomari et al., 2015).  I have definately noticed this when using Java for development.  I recently finished a project for work that consisted of five similar microservices using Spring Boot Java.  I can attest to the fact that there a lot of boilerplate (which Spring Boot really helps to reduce).
