        My name is Brad and I am from Sugar Land, Texas; however, I currently live in northwest Arkansas.  I do small development/tech projects in my spare time but I don't have much to spare anymore.  During the spare time I do have, I mostly do things with my family.  I have a wife and
        <b>three</b>
        children.

        I chose to study computer science in order to advance myself and my career.  I am currently a self-taught systems engineer in WalMart's Information Security department with no degree so if I want to be a senior engineer one day it will be good to have a degree of some kind.  My end-game is probably to become a principal engineer.

        I have a fairly solid understanding of enterprise-level development but I am lacking in a few departments so I am hoping that the computer science courses SNHU offers will fill the gaps and then some.

        My comfort level with programming is high.  I am fortunate to be on a career path that offers variety and unpredictability.  Accordingly, I have had to adopt the use of different programming languages.

        I would say that the time it takes me to pick up a new language has been reduced significantly since my beginnings.  For instance, I could probably pick up the fundamentals of a new language and have a solid deployment in a day or two.

        I never know the proper names for some basic concepts in practice.  For example, a recent one was: ternary operators.  I find things like that harder to remember than to apply.  That is the only one that comes to mind but if someone were to ask me to explain someone else's code at a low level I probably would not have the vocabulary.  Maybe.  But probably not.

        I have zero experience with C++.  I looked into learning it in my youth but never did a deep dive.

        I have relevant experience in DevOps, system architecture, cloud, containerization, *nix (sysadmin), server hardware, the list goes on but I am modest so ask and I will promptly tell you I have no idea what
        <i>x</i>
        is.
