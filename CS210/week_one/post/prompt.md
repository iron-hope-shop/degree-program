# In your initial post for this discussion, introduce yourself to your peers (e.g., where youâ€™re from, interests, family).
My name is Brad and I am from Sugar Land, Texas; however, I currently live in northwest Arkansas.  I do small development/tech projects in my spare time but I don't have much to spare anymore.  During the spare time I do have, I mostly do things with my family.  I have a wife and <b>three</b> children.

# Why did you choose to study computer science?
I chose to study computer science in order to advance myself and my career.  I am currently a self-taught systems engineer in WalMart's Information Security department with no degree so if I want to be a senior engineer one day it will be good to have a degree of some kind.  My end-game is probably to become a principal engineer.

# How will computer science help you in reaching your goals?
I have a fairly solid understanding of enterprise-level development but I am lacking in a few departments so I am hoping that the computer science courses SNHU offers will fill the gaps and then some.

# What is your comfort level with programming?
My comfort level with programming is high.  I am fortunate to be on a career path that offers variety and unpredictability.  Accordingly, I have had to adopt the use of different programming languages.

# What are your programming strengths?
I would say that the time it takes me to pick up a new language has been reduced significantly since my beginnings.  For instance, I could probably pick up the fundamentals of a new language and have a solid deployment in a day or two.

# Which skills need improvement?
I never know the "scientific" name for algorithms nor concepts in practice.  For example: ternary operators.  That is the only one that comes to mind but if someone were to ask me to explain someone else's code at a low-level I probably would not have the vocabulary.

# What experience do you have with C++?
I have zero experience with C++.  I looked into learning it in my youth but never did a deep dive.

# What experience do you have with other programming languages?
I have relevant experience in DevOps, system architecture, cloud, containerization, *nix (sysadmin), server hardware, the list goes on but I am modest so ask and I will promptly tell you I have no idea what <i>x</i> is.
