        Given my life-long love of computers, I figured this would be an excellent means of furthering this goal and increasing my career marketability. Not to mention, salaries in STEM tend to be a lot better than my current situation.

        Do what you love and you will never work a day in your life!  I think I came to this realization a little late but better late than never.  Tech is awesome and it is a great way to effect changes.

        I have a bit of knowledge of Java and Python, however my knowledge of C++ is limited. I’ve fiddled with Arduino in the past — which o believe is based around the language — but I am nowhere near proficient.

        Oh, wow!  Yeah, Arduino is based on C/C++.  I had forgotten about that.  I might have to fiddle with my Arduino now.  Side note, did you know there is a subset of Python called MicroPython (there is also CircuitPython) which I found to be a cheaper and equally powerful alternative to Arduino?  You can get a PCB compatible with micropython (Wi-Fi capable) for less than $7!
