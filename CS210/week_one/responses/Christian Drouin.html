        I have worked many different blue collar jobs and I much prefer to work from a desk.

        Yes!  My working career started a bit later than most but before my current job I had a few blue collar jobs.  Working from an air conditioned home beats weedeating in the heat any day.

        My comfort level with programing is somewhere around a 6 out of 10. I feel very comfortable with the extreme basics, but I am struggling with connecting classes with subclasses. I am struggling with getting and setting things within classes. I really enjoy loops and find them incredibly interesting!

        You should try <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">codewars</a> to get familiar with intermediate programming skills.  It is basically like answering predetermined stack overflow questions.
