    So far I have learned a lot about C++ and programming in general from this class.  The coolest thing I thought of that we have learned about is overloading functions (4.13).  My perception of low-level languages has changed a lot.  C++ is a lot different than Java (with which I am familiar) and it is sometimes overwhelming.  Getting familiar with commonly used libraries has been the hardest for me.  While working on project one, I did a massive amount of Googling and I spent a while playing with the compiler.  I found a LOT of different libraries that included time and it was hard for me to determine which was the best fit.  I did not want to reinvent the wheel when making my clocks so I imported those libraries and worked from there.  It has been a pretty busy week and if I were going to change one thing about my approach it would be: the amount of time that I had allocated for the project/assignment work.  I will definately be giving myself a break from work to focus more on schoolwork.
