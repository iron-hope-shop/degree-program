    The most interesting thing I learned during Modules Six and Seven was JNI.  I was able to easily implement it within the Lab environment; however, it really took some doing to get the interface to work locally and as you probably know by now I prefer to work within my own IDE.  So that was an adventure... The Hello World JNI tutorial probably took me ten times longer than it should have but I learned a little bit about the intricacies of JNI development on OSX so it was worth it.

    My perception of using Java at all has actually changed a lot since I began this course.  I used to hate Java the most but now I accept Java and abhor the complexity of C++.  I was talking about this to some coworkers and one of them stated, "I think Python is hard.  I prefer C it makes more sense to me."  So from that I gathered there is a preferred programming language for every personality type-- and C++ is not mine (though I wish it was)!

    I overcame roadblocks by reviewing the text on topics I was uncertain about.  This along with copious amounts of Googling (mostly regarding configuring JNI on OSX) led me to the promised land.  I once stated that beginning a new language is 90% Googling/reading library docs until you have a grasp and then it dwindles down to 5-10%.  I believe this would take eons with C++ and if I am ever bed-ridden for an extended period of time I will circle back to C++.
