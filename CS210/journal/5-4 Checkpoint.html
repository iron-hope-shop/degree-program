    The most interesting thing I learned in modules Four and Five were linked lists.  I thought that it was a complicated and useful feature.  My perception on this topic has changed drastically since the beginning, this was a lot of information to take in and I only had this Sunday to do the work due to family matters.  I really did not overcome any roadblocks this week as I did not have time.  I will take whatever credit I can get.  I definately need more time to do this course or perhaps less modules per week but I do not think that will change.
