        One of the main problems with the app, which diminishes the user experience, is the in-app video player, as it tends to freeze or the video controls disappear, which is frustrating sometimes. Therefore my main recommendation would be to either utilize a third-party video player within the app or update and fix the current one.

        I also use the mobile app and have noticed the same thing.  Also swiping between video/gif posts is a nightmare, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  It's not a huge deal but defintely annoying enough for me to close the app every so often.
