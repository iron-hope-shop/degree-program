        I have an STR (short term rental) on Airbnb, so naturally I find myself on their app every few minutes or so during the day. It's safe to say my phone lives in front of my face, but it's unavoidable. If anyone would like to see it, I will provide the link below;

        Wow, that's awesome!  I can't relate to being an entrepreneur but I can relate to the latter.

        I have never used the Airbnb app.  Usually when we stay in hotels we are using reward points or something.  I'm never the one who sets that stuff up... anyway, these seem like genuinely constructive critisms of the application.  I hate it when apps devolve to something TOO basic.  The similarity between the app you chose, Airbnb, and the app I chose, GMail, is that the web app is more fully-featured.  Hopefully more companies realize mobile users often need the same features as desktop users.
