        These new gen MMOs are pretty self-actualized, huh?  I had the same problem with Hearthstone but that is a whole other story.  I think the monitization of mobile MMOs like this has reached its fullest potential for the time being.  It is basically gambling and it really feeds that craving of wanting to constantly be better and see cooler stuff.  Also it is neverending!  Genius!  I think this app's monitization strategy could be successful for other mobile games but not for all mobile applications because not all types of apps have a progression system; however, when it comes to asthetics I believe other app developers would be surprised who would pay $5 to change the color of their text in messaging application (see Twitch).  Also I have to say the gacha reminds me of-- don't judge me-- Maplestory from the olden days.  My inner weeb is showing uwu'.
