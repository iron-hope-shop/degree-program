        This goes back to the dopamine feedback loop. You don't want the user to put the device down. You want them craving more. When you put a hard limit (time) on their advancement and play, the user will purchase the upgrades.

        I think you have captured the model in these few sentences.  The model is to play off of emotional responses in order to make money and unfortunately it works well!  The app I chose to discuss (Instagram) also kind of plays off of peoples' emotions; however, it is built upon an entirely different model.  Ads show on Instagram and the advertiser and app developer make money.  In your scenario, ads are only for the game and there is no creator to be rewarded.  I am sure there are people streaming Clash on Youtube and Twitch... do you know if there is any integration for creators?  I think that would add an entirely new dynamic to the model as well, users could work toward a more self-sustaining gameplay.
