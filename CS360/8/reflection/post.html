        One thing I learned from my experience with project three is how quickly an Android app can be spun up.  I had limited time to work on the project last week so Sunday morning I began creating my application based on the views from the previous assignment.  I quickly realized it is a lot easier than it used to be to make an Android application!  A few hours and the project was completed, I learned a lot about activity classes, SQLiteOpenHelper, components, and everything related to Android development really!  One question I still have about developing and launching a mobile app is about intellectual property.  How are there so many duplicate apps on the store which do the same thing?  For example, Wordle.  The real Wordle isn't even an Android native app, it's a web app; however, there are tens of replicants in the Google Play Store.  Could I just rip off an app, pay Google to advertise it over other apps, and steal traffic from other apps?  Sounds like a horrible model for an app distribution platform.

        I hope to create a publicly-available Android application in the future.  I will apply all of my learnings when designing and creating my application based on what we learned in this class about best practices.  I am thinking my application will be a relatively simple interface which revolves around some bleeding-edge machine learning model.  We shall see, and best of luck to everyone!
