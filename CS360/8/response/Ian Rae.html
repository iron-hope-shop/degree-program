        When designing applications it is important to do research on how others have implemented a users requirements as well as brainstorming how you would like to implement a user's requirements. During this process each requirement should be individually addressed so when it comes to developing everything is accounted for. This means if if your requirement is storing users data, you will then research the best way to add this functionality to your app. For example, in Android Studio this was by using SQLite database to enter user data and implement unique user ids for each new user.

        Yes!  Knowing what stack, framework, or library is best for your scenario is very important when developing applications.  The only way to know is exposure and looking up similar applications is a very effective way of approaching the design process.  I probably need to do this more during my design phase; however, I think this is more important when approaching new systems.  The next time I have to develop an application for a system with which I am unfamiliar, I will borrow from your method!
