        Typically people asking for certain things do not know the ins and outs of what it is exactly that they are
        asking. An important job is to be able to correctly interpret what it is that they mean rather than just flat
        out say. I approach the designing aspect as if I were a consumer for the product. What would I like to use, and
        go from there.

        This is true. Oftentimes developers have to curb expectations by letting product managers or other stakeholders
        know what is possible. Sometimes people ask for moon.

        When developing this time i started off with the design and then made everything work, but I wonder if doing it
        the other way would be more beneficial?

        Designing an application rather than just diving right in an making commitments is very important. Part of the
        reason is because in the real world we have security protocols, development protocols, and most of the
        development process is paperwork. Avoiding common pitfalls by laying out what you need and nothing more is
        another effective way to execute projects. I will always measure twice and cut once!
