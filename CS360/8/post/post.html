        I lean on the market research of others when it comes to interpreting user needs.  For instance, product managers, stakeholders, teammates, etc.  If it is solely based on my judgement I try to gather as much data as possible about the project before making a decision.  I am also very big on cost effectiveness and reducing technical debt.  Whenever I implement what a user has communicated into an application I try to get feedback on it as quickly as possible.  A good rule of thumb is to design applications based on what the user wants not what you want (even if you just learned about some new stack, framework, etc).

        My approach to designing applications is to gather requirements and create a mind map/flow chart.  I try to think of any applications I work on as being object-oriented which helps me better understand and apply concepts.  If I have done a similar project I will reflect on that project.  Building off of past failures and success generally improves the quality of my projects.  I will also reiterate that you should always measure twice and cut once.

        I am biased because I am a developer but by the time I have gotten to the development phase (all projects probably start with some spitballing/small scripts for me) I already know the path I am going to take.  I try to switch between languages for each project just to keep current on frameworks; however, I will not do this if it will become a detriment the process.  I try to build applications in a modular way and deploy them quickly so that I can gather user feedback.
