        I think that Snapchat may be more visually appealing than Google Maps because Snapchat does not have to conform to global brands standards.  Snapchat also uses unlabeled navigational features such as the side screen swipe.  There is only a tutorial at the beginning to show you that the swiping is possible to direct you.  Meanwhile, Google is not using unlabeled features like swiping from the side of the screen.  I believe the elements which need to be in Google Maps are all there, it is just not visually appealing due to the branding.  The typography of all of Google's apps is very readable and is only ever used on white/black high contrast backgrounds.  The theme conforms to Google's icon and color scheme.  I think it is an eventuality for Google to make their apps minimal and use swiping, etc.
