        In my opinion, LinkedIn's feed within the main activity is too much like Facebook.  The layout is cluttered with ads and promoted posts!  It is for this reason I do not use it daily, it is just a utility app for me.  There is just too much noise for me to peruse the feed.  In terms of color/themes I use iOS and it does default to inheret system theme settings.  So when dark mode was added I had no idea and eventually stumbled upon it in the settings.  Overall, in my opinion, decluttering the newsfeed by lessening the agression of their ad algo and making users aware of new features/defaulting app settings to system settings would improve user experience.
