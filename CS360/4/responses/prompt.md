# In responses to your peers, consider whether you have the same assessment of their apps' design success. 

# Based on your peer's assessment and your own, determine what updates you would make to improve one of the apps' designs. Propose changes in at least two of the four element categories (themes, color, typography, and layout) and explain why those changes would likely be more successful. Remember to reference design best practices in your responses.

In my opinion, LinkedIn's feed within the main activity is too much like Facebook.  The layout is cluttered with ads and promoted posts!  It is for this reason I do not use it daily, it is just a utility app for me.  There is just too much noise for me to peruse the feed.  In terms of color/themes I use iOS and it does default to inheret system theme settings.  So when dark mode was added I had no idea and eventually stumbled upon it in the settings.  Overall, in my opinion, decluttering the newsfeed by lessening the agression of their ad algo and making users aware of new features/defaulting app settings to system settings would improve user experience.

I think that Snapchat may be more visually appealing than Google Maps because Snapchat does not have to conform to global brands standards.  Snapchat also uses unlabeled navigational features such as the side screen swipe.  There is only a tutorial at the beginning to show you that the swiping is possible to direct you.  Meanwhile, Google is not using unlabeled features like swiping from the side of the screen.  I believe the elements which need to be in Google Maps are all there, it is just not visually appealing due to the branding.  The typography of all of Google's apps is very readable and is only ever used on white/black high contrast backgrounds.  The theme conforms to Google's icon and color scheme.  I think it is an eventuality for Google to make their apps minimal and use swiping, etc.
