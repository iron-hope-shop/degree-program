# What is one thing you have learned from your experience with Project One?
My experience with our first project taught me that user experience should be considered before planning backend implementations.  It is too often that product owners or engineers are determined on using a certain tech stack or framework to meet user needs when the entire system architecture could me made better if it were oriented around what the user wants and needs.  I was not very familiar with mobile application design but it is oriented around the frontend with very simple backend integrations.  This is the opposite way I have been taught to engineer systems.  Usually we are focused on the backend and the interface, whatever that might mean, is a product of the frameworks we used for the backend.
# What is one question you still have about mobile application design?
One question I still have about mobile application design is what is the best way to gather market data in the real world if I want to make an app on my own?
# What is one way you will apply your learning from Project One in the future?
Project one is the amalgam of all our learning in this course until that point.  I will apply the principles I learned throughout the textbook such as working with activity lifecycles, layouts, and widgets in our next project.
