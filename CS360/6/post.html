        One thing I learned from my experience with Project Two is the application of components which were mentioned in our textbook.  TableLayout is one such component which fell into the purview of my Project Two.  I learned how to create child TableRow components and populate them with data.  One question I still have about mobile application development is about being successful on the Play Store or App Store.  I am curious what factors add up to a successful app and what the best market strategies are for spreading the word about an app.  I will apply my learning from Project Two in the future by incorporating a backend into the login screen.  Additionally, I will integrate a database into the TableLayout and other components to make their attributes change based on stateful data.
