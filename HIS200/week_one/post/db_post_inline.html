        My name is Brad Jackson and grew up in Sugar Land, Texas.  I moved to Bentonville, Arkansas to work for Walmart.  Currently I am an engineer in Walmart's information security division.  I am taking courses through SNHU in order to obtain a B.S. in CompSci.  I have enjoyed my courses so far but I really came here to refine my knowledge of the theory and application of technology to business.  My goal for this course is to gain a different perspective on critical thinking and analysis.

        But anti-Catholic attitudes persisted and they came to the fore in the 1830s and 1840s, as large numbers of Irish and German Catholics entered the country. Anti-Catholicism plus nativist sentiment proved to be a volatile mixture. Protestant mobs burned St. Mary's church in New York in 1831 and the Ursuline Convent outside Boston in 1834 and the Philadelphia Bible Riots of 1844 left almost 20 people, both Protestants and Catholics, dead. And prominent Protestant clergymen, such as Lyman Beecher and Horace Bushnell, attacked the Catholic church as anti-American.

        I chose an early example of Irish presence in the United States to illustrate the concept of change over time.  The recent influx of Scots Irish settlers created a new target for American prejudice.  Earlier in the text it is noted that before this time in history, American society had featured a strong anti-Catholic streak.  This created tension and eventually violence between the American population and the Irish.  In my opinion, this was one of the first catalysts for the eventual acceptance of the Irish-Catholic presence in the United States.

        The article as a whole gives me a better understanding of the changing perception of Irish immigrants in America by describing major historical events in the order that they happened.  The introduction of Irish immigrants initially sparked violence and predjudice from Americans but ended in the assimilation of the Irish by America.  Several factors helped in this acceptance toward Irish imigrants; however, the fact that Irish fought to preserve the Union (even if it was avantageous or forced upon them) relivied the social tension and was the main factor for their acceptance into American cutlure.
