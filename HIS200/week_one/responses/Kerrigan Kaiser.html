        After reading the article some forces that basically helped them adapt were there jobs. I know for me personally when I got my current job I felt like an immigrant.  I had never worked in that field before and basically was started a brand-new career, no experience and dint know fully what to expect. But thankfully I was able to adapt and learn new things every day. Same with the immigrants, every day was a new day and eventually they began to learn more and more and grow from there experience.

        This is an interesting insight if only to make us stop and consider how much we, ourselves, truly belong in any given situation.  After all, the citizens who inhabited America during the timespan of the article had only been there for about 250 years.  That is a pretty small length of time compared to the entirey of mankind's existence.
