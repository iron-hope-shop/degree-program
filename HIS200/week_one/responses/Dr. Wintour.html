        Is the Irish experience useful either because of similarities or differences with other groups?

        I think that the Irish experience is paralleled by antisemitism in the United States.  The persecution of Jews can be traced back to ancient times.  In the 1900s the Ku Klux Klan was a large terrorist group that threatened many ethnic demographics.  Similarly to the Irish-Catholics, the hatred seemed to die down after a large conflict.  I think that the Holocaust was a major factor in the lessening of antisemitism in America.  This comparison is interesting since it relates in many ways to the Irish experience.  I am not sure how useful this information is since war was the catalyst for change in both instances.
