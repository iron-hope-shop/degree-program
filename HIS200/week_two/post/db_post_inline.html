        For my research topic I have chosen Prohibition in the United States.  The specific event I chose was the 1920 prohibition of alcohol which lasted until 1933.  I will pose the question, "Did the 1920s Prohibition cause more damage to society than it fixed?"  As you probably know, organized crime rates increased and a large number of United States citizens continued to consume alcohol in speakeasies.

        If I were researching the topic of Québécois immigration I would research deeper into the long-term effects of Canadian influence in the area.  The text says that the Québécois formed "Little Canadas."  Assmiliation personally makes me think that the culture disappeared into our own.  Is this true?  Or did we adopt certain aspects of their culture that remain in New England until this day?
