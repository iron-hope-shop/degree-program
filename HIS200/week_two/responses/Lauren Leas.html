        The Seneca Falls Convention took place in New York during the year of 1848 and was the start of the Womenâ€™s Suffrage Movement. The convention was created by two high society women, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Lucretia Mott, leading 300 women to speak and demand change within gender equality. During the convention, they created the Declaration of Sentiments, based off of the Declaration of Independence, it demanded equality with men before the law in education and employment.

        Wow, I had no idea that the first conventional meeting for womens' rights to vote was in 1848.  The 19th Amendment was passed around 1920, right?  I understand these things too time; however, I have a similar question: Did the Declaration of Sentiments also create a sort of "plan of attack" or was it just a list of demands?  The publication of that document on a national scale could be considered a plan of attack but I was just curious if there was more immediate action taken in view of that document.
