        When performing my research, I really would like to know if there was a singular event that triggered the women's movement, or if it was a series of small events that made it possible. During my preliminary search, I have found that within the women's suffrage movement there was an  Afro-American component to the movement as well. I'm still not sure how big of a role they played. Was it a key component? Was it Afro-American who helped with the overall movement, or was it a separate movement that also pushed for Afro-American women to vote?

        One question that I have is: In terms of the end result, who were the greatest players in this scenario?  I'm sure there is a lot of overlap of political figures as well, since you are focusing on African-American women.  For example, this would not have been possible without setting the standard for African-American men voting via the 15th Amendment.  Was there some overlap between the political figures or forces who made that happen and the ones that passed the 19th Amendment?  A lot of minor and major events led to the 19th Amendment.  It reminds me of a quote from the Martian where he says something like "you keep solving problems until you eventually make it home."  I hope this is helpful!
