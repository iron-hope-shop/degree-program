        "Congressional champions of ERA in the early 1970s simply did not expect problems securing state approval.
        Neither Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana nor Representative Martha Griffiths of Michigan, the measure's principal
        congressional sponsors, anticipated any difficulty in winning ratification for the ERA."

        The author dedicates his opening statements telling us that the ERA expected an easier road towards approval
        than the one that it got. It's a sentence that eloquently captures the fact that even duly elected officials
        championing a solid cause, sometimes gets it wrong.

        Your selection sheds a different light on the Equal Rights Amendment's (ERA) struggles than mine:

        Originally known as Mott's Amendment in honor of Lucretia Mott, one of the organizers of the Seneca Falls
        Convention, Paul's proposed amendment led to a sharp division in the feminist movement.

        I outlined the fact that Alice Paul caused feminists to split into two factions while you argued a different
        reason that the ERA struggled to pass. Without a doubt these two factors contributed to the delay in the
        enactment of the ERA.
