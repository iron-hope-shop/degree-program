        In your first selection it reads "While his endorsement was hardly critical" which makes it evident to me that Wilson's endorsement was not essential to the Women's Suffrage Movement's triumph in 1920.  I focused on the movement at a smaller level, focusing on the workers that effected change.  My argument was that these campaigns were a necessary cause to the Women's Suffrage Movement's triumph.
