        In the long run, busing hurt Boston because it led to violent racial strife, contributed to white flight, and damaged the quality of the public school system.  Busing was successful in desegregating schools but did not improve the quality of education in public schools.  These effects can be seen in the data, "in 1996 ... At Dorchesterâ€™s William E. Endicott School, 95 percent of the fifth-graders scored 'poor' or 'failing' in reading and 100 percent scored 'poor' or 'failing' in math" (Hoover Institution, 1998).  This is evidence of a lack of focus on quality in the educational system in Boston.  Initially desegregation led to violence within Boston schools.  This violence was not localized but was spread across multiple schools; however, extreme violence was limited to only a few schools.  According to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1975):

        Disorders related to school desegregation tended to occur primarily when school opened and closed, with only scattered disorders at midday and rarely between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. Although approximately 80 schools were affected by Phase I, serious disorders occurred only at South Boston schools and at Hyde Park, Boston English, and Roslindale High Schools. Violence and significant injury occurred only at South Boston and Hyde Park High Schools.

        It was argued that during the early integration of desegregation that "white flight" would increase due to the newly enacted programs.  In addition to publishing reports on testing in desegregated schools, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights " predicted that segregation is likely to increase in the North due to white flight to suburbs" (Wolff, 2015).
