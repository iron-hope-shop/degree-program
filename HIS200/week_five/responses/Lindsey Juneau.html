        One consequence that came with his death came a lot of anger, hatred and grudges which ultimately led to riots. He was a spokesmen and the voice of many people and the his loss led to a lot of heartbreak and many unanswered questions. If he wouldn't have been assassinated I have to wonder what other great movements he could have accomplished. Would he have changed communities or even the nation?

        Martin Luther King, Jr.'s death definately left the African American civil rights movement open ended.  I also wonder what great strides would have been made toward this movement had King not died.  In my post I pondered the thought that the current state of the African American civil rights movement is in disorder possibly due to the fact that King met an early death.  I believe he would have continued to set the standard and be the driving force for something that would have alliviated a lot of pain that exists today.
