        If Dr. King had not been assassinated eventually he would have rallied all Americans together so that there would be equality between all races because he has such a powerful speaker and believed in what he was doing.  However, I believe that the Act passed as quickly as it did as a ploy to bring about peace and to end the rioting.

        Interesting thoughts on the relationship between King's assassination and the passing of the Fair Housing Act.  It certainly would have eventually happened; however, it may not have happened as quickly.  If the act was passed in order to subdue a rebellion, I wonder how effective it really was.  I think that the current state of the African American civil rights movement is a testament to the fact that Johnson only put a bandaid on the problem rather than fixing it.
