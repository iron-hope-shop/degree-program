        While it is not accurate to say that the civil rights movement had any one, single leader, it is nonetheless clear that the movement began to crumble after the assassination of Martin Luther King in April 1968. The loss of King as an eloquent advocate of nonviolent protest definitely hurt the movement. And perhaps more important, the wave of racial violence that convulsed many cities in the wake of King's death shattered whatever fragile political consensus might have been forming behind the idea of comprehensive reforms to address the root causes of racial discrimination and African-American poverty.

        If Dr. King had not been killed, African American civil rights might have been driven to be a more widespread issue.  In an alternate history, with King as a driving factor, this cultural revolution may have led to reducing racism and spreading awareness.  We may not have the issues we are seeing today where riots are happening as a result of police brutality and racism.  The web text addresses this point directly:

        While the modern civil rights movement succeeded, in large measure, in bringing about the end of legal segregation in the Old South, the problems of racism and inequality—the legacy of "America's original sin"—have yet to be fully addressed.

        One specific consequence of Dr. King's assassination was that, without a unified voice, the African American civil rights movement became a farce.  It is hard to say if this would have taken place if King had not been assassinated because his agenda could have shifted over time; however, it is reasonable to assume that Dr. King would have addressed more modern issues as time passed on.

        Another consequence of King's death was rioting.  People were justifiably appalled that their champion was murdered in cold blood.  Because the focus of the riots were the assassination of Dr. King, it is doubtful that they would have happened if he had lived.
