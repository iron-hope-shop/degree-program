        When looking at my own topic, to fully understand it more I could take a look at the "other side" of the situation and see why those individuals felt the way that they did, in terms look into the why men in history felt that they only needed the power and advantage over women.

        Unfortunately the prompt did not have us explicitly post our topics so I am assuming that your topic is the Women's Rights movement or something similar.  My preconceived notions around your topic are based on social and scientific aspects.  Women are physically different from men and inherently weaker so since the beginning of time it has been more of a social fight to get the rights they deserve.  I think that it is a sad fact that it took so long after the United States because "civilized" for women to gain ground in this arena.  I would look at the natural or phychological causes of the role of women played in society before laws were created to balance the sexes.
