        In my research of the "Trail of Tears," I have learned that the historical complexity is that the state and federal governments went far and beyond to gain control of the Natives' land.

        I always assumed that white settlers were the only ones at fault since this conflict would have been delayed had the Americas not been discovered.  I guess the fact that it did happen incited guerrilla tactics between the two warring parties.  I would also be interested to see how desertion played a role during this time in history.
