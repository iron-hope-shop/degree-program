                <p>Portrait of the Boy Eutyches</p>
                <p>
                    The purpose for the creation of the "Portrait of the Boy Eutyches" was most likely to commemorate his existence.  The painting style of this artifact is Greek in origin.  Egypt was culturally diverse during the creation of this artifact so it does not nessicarily mean the painter was Greek.  Egypt was ruled by Greece and then overtaken by Rome.  The cultural significance of this artifact relates to the afterlife.  When a person died, the portrait panel was placed over the face of the mummy with parts of the outermost wrapping holding it in place.

I believe its creator felt the need to express themself to express their cultural diversity and beliefs.  Eygpt was a cultural melting pot and the artist likely came from an atypical background.

                <p>Canterbury Cathedral</p>
                <p>I believe the purpose for the creation of the Canterbury Cathedral was to establish a base for the spread of Christianity.  The architecture was heavily influenced by ancient Roman style, as seen in the accents and statues of the structure.  The middle ages encompassed a period of time where Christianity spread across the known world and was a time wrought with holy wars.  The massive cathedral stood as a beacon or outpost for lost souls to gather in this medieval time.

                    I believe the creators felts the need to express the beauty of the old ways of design juxtaposed with the beliefs of the current era.  The cathedral is a sort of hat tip to ancient Roman architects.</p>

                <p>Statue of David</p>
                <p>
                    I believe the purpose of the statue of David was to give a face to a name.  The statue of David was originally began by another, unknown, artist; however, it was abandoned and unfinished.  Michelangelo was comissioned to finish the statue due to the popularity of David in Florence at the time.  The biblical figure David was a symbol for a political awakening and a hero among the common people of Florence, Italy.  Michelangelo simply put a physical face to his name.

I believe Michelangelo felt the need to showcase his talent and ability by turning an unfinished statue into a success story.
