        My name is Bradley Jackson and I am majoring in computer science at Southern New Hampshire University.  I am twenty-five years of age.  This is my second semester here, before which I was majoring in business administration at Brandman University.  I have worked at Wal-Mart’s home office in Bentonville, Arkansas, for about 20 months.  My current team supports all of the servers in the home office environment (in data centers and home office buildings) but I was recently offered a position on a team in information security.  I like my current position; however, I am excited to be doing something new and challenging.  As far as hobbies go, I am a bit of a nerd.  I listen to software engineering podcasts, tinker with servers, and have been honing my abilities with Python.  To me this course is a small part on my way to becoming a degree-bearing adult.  Working on core credits, from my experience, is like digging for gold.  While laborious, you are more likely to find a nugget with time and appreciate it that much more.  I hope to find the nugget.

        Kaleem and Kristof have very bleak views on the outlook for society.  Kaleem states that “we are moving toward a way of life that discourages the kinds of conversations that defined and sustained Cherkasova and Kornilov’s friendship” (2013).  I strongly disagree with this hypothesis.  Personally, it is my friends whom I have kept in contact with solely through social media that I confide in the most. Both Kaleem an Kristof believe that the downward spiral of humanity correlates to the downward trend of humanities graduates.  “Just seven percent of graduates major in the humanities” (Kaleem, 2013).  From my experience, exposure to the humanities happens more in daily life than exposure to technical concepts.  A solution to this worry would be to supplement your educational career with the occasional audiobook about philosophy.  I believe that most people will seek their own answers, humanities major or not.  Kristof builds upon the idea that “literature seems to offer lessons in human nature that help us decode the world around us and be better friends” (2015).  It is often that I find myself listening to a podcast that references the work of an author whose philosophy changes the way I view the world, even in a small way.  People do not need to focus their life’s work on literature or philosophy in order to demonstrate a need for the humanities, the humanities are inevitable.

        I have always believed that everyone needs an artistic outlet.  Composing a short melody, drawing, or creating a model are all fantastic ways to get the juices flowing.  In her article about artists, Barnicoat observed that the studio is “where we can witness the intriguing moment when a maker’s secret inner world spills into a place that we can share it” (2015).  This speaks to me because most of my projects and creations have a centralized theme.  We all have a plan in our mind, and it helps to lay it out into the world.  This is not an easy task, as Barnicoat notes:

        In one corner of the room, Sam sits on his stool by the window, earmuffs on, just thinking. At some point he will get up, reach for the yellow paint and blast it into the centre of a huge canvas, watching as it streams in yolky rivulets to the ground. Then he’ll sit back down to think some more.

        It is important to actively plan projects from a relaxed perspective.  Sam is in the epicenter of comfort and focus as he measures twice and cuts once, exacting his will upon his canvas.  Albert Greere also meticulously plans out his artwork.  “He works quietly with complete focus, thinking hard before making any mark” (Barnicoat, 2015).  Everyone should have an artistic outlet like Sam and Albert, who have embraced the amazing opportunity of artistic expression and subsequently live fuller lives.
