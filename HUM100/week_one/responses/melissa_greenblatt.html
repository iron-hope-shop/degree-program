        Nice to meet you, and best of luck on your educational adventure!  It's great that you spend your time volunteering.  I should probably invest some of my time into giving back to my community.

        I agree with his article because our society has so many knowledgeable resources we do not use because most of kids today are focused on social media. People relate more to facebook posts and their peers around them than people of higher education or perhaps reading the information themselves.

        I often criticize my friends and family for using their phones for social media.  Smartphones are a bottomless resource of knowledge and should be used to spread relevant information for living, not apochryphal memes.  I think it all boils down to human nature and the need for instant gratification rather than working for an answer.  It is so much easier to aimless scroll through pages upon pages of random "facts."
