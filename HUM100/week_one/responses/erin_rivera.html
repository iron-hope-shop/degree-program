        Hello fellow peers! My name is Erin Rivera. I am a mother and grandmother who enjoys sp nding as much time possible with my family. I enjoy movies and reading books on my spare time. I am currently working on my bachelor's in psychology. I agree with Kristoff and Kaleem for this discussion. Kristoff statement about us drowning in info reigns true to society today. We lost connection with communication and personal relations. We have began to rely more on what we can look up on the internet rather than exploring it personally.

        Hi Erin and welcome!  It is ironic that advanced technology has brought with it a lack of communication.  In terms of relying on information rather than exploring it, I think the problem there is a lack of education around information fluency.  Schools should actively and thoroughly teach students to question and validate information.  Maybe there should be a disclaimer that when you buy an internet-connected device, you have to verify that you have taken a course on information literacy; however, that would probably be too high of a barrier to entry.
