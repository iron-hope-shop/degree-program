        I think the statue represented how the Greeks were unified as a city-state and how much power they had. There were many people threatened by it. The Greeks believed Zeus to be the God of Gods so he held the most power. I believe the creator intended for people to remember the unity and strength and order they had in order to achieve a fully functioning society, but there were people who disagreed with them and wanted to tear it down. There are many theories as to how but we may never know.

        I agree that the statue helped to symbolize the unity of the Greeks; futhermore, I would like to expand more on the religious significance of the statue as it related to their nation.  Zeus was the son of one of the dreaded titans, Cronus, and with the help of his brothers and sisters, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Demeter, and Hera, he overthrew Cronus (Struck, 2000).  I believe it was likely raized due to the religious symbolism during the transition to a new empirical reign.
