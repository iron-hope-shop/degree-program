        As the family is in hiding, this causes emotion distress to all family members, resulting in many fights. I believe she created the artifact to write about the war, the horrors her and her family faced everyday and to record her feelings she was experiencing throughout the process.

        I believe that the only real reason that Anne recorded her thoughts was for personal comfort.  Over time, I think she recognized that the history she kept would be useful but I doubt she had any hope of it becoming as widespread as it did.  Along with the enduring ideas that you mentioned, and despite the family fights, I think two more enduring ideas that the diary conveys is community and Interdependence.  Without the help and continued support of eachother, the family would never have survived as long as they did.
