        I have chosen the Great Pyramid at Giza as my subject.  This time-worn wonder of the world symbolizes wealth, power, and spirituality.  Of the seven wonders of the ancient world, it is the only that still stands (Travel Channel, 2019).  Constructing this pyramid was no small feat.  Resources were carefully pooled and King Khufu (the king of Egypt at the time) would have employed thousands of conscripted labourers (Murray, 2004).  Only a god-king would have the resources needed for this undertaking.  Peter Der Manuelian notes the organization of this ancient Egyptian government:

        The ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom (about 2650–2150 BCE) was a period of strong central government. Thus, it makes sense that its kings were able to organize the vast quantity of labor required for such vast building projects, and also that many officials chose to be buried at a site so near the capital, the focus of power.

        Through study of the pyramid we can gather some context for core Egyptian cutlure.  All along the strong walls of the inner tombs, snapshots of everyday lives and beliefs of Egyptians from all walks of life exist in the form of scenes and hieroglyphics (Manuelian, 2017).  Much can be learned from a structure that has stood for so long and was touch by so many lives.  There were even efforts to understand the daily lives of the workers and slaves whose purpose it was to erect this monument.  "Our investigations - which continue - have already demonstrated the great scale and complexity of this state-organized project, which depended on a major investment of natural resources and man hours (also, no doubt, woman hours), as well as many workmen's lives, as is suggested by the size of their cemetery above the settlement" (Murray, 2004).  As stated by Manuelian, there is also a spiritual meaning behind the pyramid; however, I believe its true purpose was to endure the test of time and carry the name "Khufu" through the millennia.
