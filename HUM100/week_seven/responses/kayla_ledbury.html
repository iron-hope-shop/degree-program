        I think that the main value of human creative expression for contemporary culture is being able to inspire others and be inspired yourself. We all come from such diverse backgrounds and allowing our differences to inspire us to create allows us all to gain some perspective. To look at a painting or a sculpture or read a book and suddenly be able to see things from the artist perspective is magical. Creative expression helps to humanize people, the perspective creative expression can give can turn a faceless stranger on the street into a unique individual with a story in our minds.

        I agree with your statement about inspiration and I had a similar point in my post.  The world is moving forward together while cultures and ideas are mixing.  I think this is ideal and it is one of the foundations of the humanities.

        I think contemporary culture has had significant impact on creative expression and the humanities. One way in which contemporary culture and modern technology has impacted creative expression is through digital books. Thanks to Amazon much of the world now consumes its literature digitally. Subscriptions such as kindle unlimited allows for book reading to be affordable, those who may not have been able to read new books outside of what their library had available now can read the latest books from their favorite authors as soon as its released. Amazon has also given many authors who previously may not have had the resources or opportunities to have their book published more options as well. Amazon has a program that allows authors to self publish their books digitally through amazon, this allows more authors to get their creations out into society and allows for more diverse literary material to be more easily accessible.

        As far as the connection between human expression and ethical values, I believe that in this case the two are joined.  Amazon has provided opportunity for both readers and writers to collaborate while saving resources such as time, money, and paper.  This conservation of resources and preservation of artifacts is extremely valuable to our culture.
