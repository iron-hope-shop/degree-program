        Much has influenced humanities whether it is science that states everything has a reason to some who feel that humanities are irrelevant due to technology. Politics have all but extinguished humanities, taking things like art and music out of schools. All in the hopes that they can beat out other countries with higher test scores.  Take cursive for example, it has been wrenched away from schools but now children are not able to read this artistic form of writing. Calligraphy too has been taken away even though there is so much beauty, history and culture behind it.

        I think that everything has a purpose.  For example, cursive-- if I am not mistaken-- was created so that people could write faster.  The writing utensil not leaving the paper allowed for greater speed but since most schoolwork is done digitally this has become relevant.  So I agree with that point; however, I do not think cursive is so much of an art than it is a tool, like computers.  Calligraphy on the other hand is a different story.  I am sure that artists will continue to draw from these archaic forms of expression in the future because most drawing applications do have a fountain pen tool.

        I feel that the main humanity that remains is art just in different expressive forms. Data and digital art has become the new fad. Much of the digital era has influenced culture. From talking to someone in person or through written letters it is now done via Facebook,  Face Time, text and Snap Chat. However, the art of language has not ended with this but flourished in its own unique way. You can blog, type out how you are feeling, use emojis to show or express yourself and catalog your life through photos and artistic memes.

        This is a point that I strongly agree with and support.  It is interesting that modern forms of communication are dominated by "leet speak," acronyms, and empojis.  It is interesting how our values have changed due to technology and in turn, our ethical considerations.  In the wrong context even emojis can carry hidden meaning and ethical values.
