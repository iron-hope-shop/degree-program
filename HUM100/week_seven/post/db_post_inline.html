        Contemporary culture is influenced by high-level trends in technology, the news, and political attitudes.  The possibilities in technology seem limited only by the ideas of human beings.  In the news and politics, most of what we see is negative.

        Technology has progressed exponentially in the last 75 years, since the invention of the modern computer.  This trend has led to an increasely interconnected world.  People are connected in more way than ever and yet human interaction has decreased.  How often do you go to the grocery store and choose to pay at an unmanned machine rather than approaching the slightly-smiling cashier one aisle over?  This juxaposition of connectivity and community has surfaced in literature, art, and cinema.  An example one such contemporary artifact is the film The Matrix.  The story takes place in a dystopian future where humans are literally wired together and yet there is no physical human interaction.  With the need for face-to-face interaction in a downward trend, random acts of violence are prevailent in the news.

        Shootings seem to happen more and more frequently as time progresses.  Schools are common targets but there have been more and more shootings are Walmarts.  Due to these grim realities staring us in the face when we eat our cereal in the morning, people are becoming desensitized to violence.  This is seen in the entertainment industry blockbuster hits such as IT, Joker, and Us.  Violence is becoming a norm and it is reflected in the humanities but so are radical political ideals.

        Politics are rank with corruption and falsehoods.  Our own president has been threatened to be impeached and it looks like the House is going to move forward with it.  Personally, I do not follow politics closely but I have seen the story of corrupt leaders a lot in cinema.  One example of this is House of Cards, which closely resembles the lives of the Clinton family.  Even in fantasy worlds politicians are corrupt: Game of Thrones for instance.  This is not neccicarily a modern trend but is certainly one that has continued to rear its ugly head.

        The main value of human expression for contemporary culture is inspiration.  In a world where we are always moving and no one "has the time," we look toward the humanities both to express ourselves in small ways and for motivation.  The world is full of potential and humans provide the ideas.
