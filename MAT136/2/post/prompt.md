P = 80
The perimeter, P, is 80cm

P = 2(L+W)
Formula for perimeter where L is length and W is width.

L = 2W + 1
The length, L, is 1 cm more than twice its width, W.

80 = 2(L+W)
Subsitute 80 for P.

80 = 2(2W+1+W)
Substitute for L.

80 = 6W+2
Apply the distributive property.

78 = 6W
Solve for W

W = 13

L = 2W + 1
Substitute 13 for W and solve for L.

L = 27
