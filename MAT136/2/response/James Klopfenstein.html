        Great job breaking down the problem and explaining your steps toward a solution. I think due to the nature of
        this problem we did not really vary in our explainations; however, one thing which you could do differently is
        use LaTex or MathML to lay out your proof. I think OpenStax has a MathML generation tool. Just a suggestion!
