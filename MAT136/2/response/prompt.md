Great job breaking down the problem and explaining your steps toward a solution.  I think due to the nature of this problem we did not really vary in our explainations; however, one thing which you could do differently is use LaTex or MathML to lay out your proof.  I think OpenStax has a MathML generation tool.  Just a suggestion!
