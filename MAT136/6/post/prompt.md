P = R - C
C = 50x + 100
R = -0.5(x-90)^2 + 4050
0 < x <= 130

1. Assuming that the company sells all that it produces, what is the profit function?
P = -0.5(x-90)^2 + 4050 - 50x - 100
P = -0.5(x-90)^2 - 50x + 3950
P = -0.5(x^2-180x+8100) - 50x + 3950
P = -0.5(x^2)+90x - 4050 - 50x + 3950
P = -0.5(x^2) + 40x - 100

2. What is the domain of P(x)?
0 < x <= 130
furthermore, we can find the range
h = -b/2a
h = -(40)/(2)(-0.5)
h = 40
P(40) = k = 700
the vertex is at a maximum at the point (plotted to verify concavity rather than delving into calculus)
(40,700)
maximum profit is 700
so the realistic range of P(x) if you want to be profitable is:
0 < P(x) <= 700

3. The company can choose to produce either 40 or 50 items. What is their profit for each case, and which level of production should they choose?
P = -0.5(x-90)^2 - 50x + 3950
P(40) = 700
P(50) = 650

4. Can you explain, from our model, why the company makes less profit when producing 10 more units?
The model has diminishing returns after 40 units.
