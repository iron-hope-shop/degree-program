        P = R - C
        <br>
        C = 50x + 100
        <br>
        R = -0.5(x-90)^2 + 4050
        <br>
        0 < x <= 130
        <br>
        <br>

        1. Assuming that the company sells all that it produces, what is the profit function?
        <br>
        P = -0.5(x-90)^2 + 4050 - 50x - 100
        <br>
        P = -0.5(x-90)^2 - 50x + 3950
        <br>
        P = -0.5(x^2-180x+8100) - 50x + 3950
        <br>
        P = -0.5(x^2)+90x - 4050 - 50x + 3950
        <br>
        P = -0.5(x^2) + 40x - 100
        <br>
        <br>

        2. What is the domain of P(x)?
        <br>
        0 < x <= 130
        <br>
        furthermore, we can find the range of profitability
        <br>
        h = -b/2a
        <br>
        h = -(40)/(2)(-0.5)
        <br>
        h = 40
        <br>
        P(40) = k = 700
        <br>
        the vertex is at a maximum at the point (plotted to verify concavity rather than delving into calculus)
        <br>
        (40,700)
        <br>
        maximum profit is 700
        <br>
        so the realistic range of P(x) if you want to be profitable is:
        <br>
        0 < P(x) <= 700
        <br>
        <br>

        3. The company can choose to produce either 40 or 50 items. What is their profit for each case, and which level of production should they choose?
        <br>
        P = -0.5(x-90)^2 - 50x + 3950
        <br>
        P(40) = 700
        <br>
        P(50) = 650
        <br>
        <br>

        4. Can you explain, from our model, why the company makes less profit when producing 10 more units?
        <br>
        The model has diminishing returns after 40 units.
