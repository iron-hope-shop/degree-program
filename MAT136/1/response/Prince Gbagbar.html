    this course will help me in my career path when i need to lay out cables for a network infrastructure or working
    with computer algorithms.

    I have never professionally laid out network lines; however I do appreciate cable management on the raised floor.
    Long ago I worked closely with our data center network teams but I never dealt with specifics. There's a <a
      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/">subreddit</a> I follow for my fix :P

    Additional resources we have are the supplemental videos in the mobius book. Personally I do not care for the format
    of this book but the resources are very helpful if you get stuck. Also they are not too far away from where we are
    turning in our work. I think the best I can hope for in terms of collaboration and peer support is these
    discussions! I look forward to posting and recieving feedback each week.
