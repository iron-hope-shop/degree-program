# What commonalities do you share with your classmates?
I have never professionally laid out network lines; however I do appreciate cable management on the raised floor.  Long ago I worked closely with our data center network teams but I never dealt with specifics.  There's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/">subreddit</a> I follow for my fix :P

# What additional resources can you share that will help you and your fellow classmates be successful?
Additional resources we have are the supplemental videos in the mobius book.  Personally I do not care for the format of this book but the resources are very helpful if you get stuck.  Also they are not too far away from where we are turning in our work.

# What opportunities can you explore for collaboration and peer support?
I think the best I can hope for in terms of collaboration and peer support is these discussions!  I look forward to posting and recieving feedback each week.
