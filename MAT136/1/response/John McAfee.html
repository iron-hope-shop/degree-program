    The only knowledge I have with this class is I took algebra in high school. I really like math (I am one of the
    few), but this class is going to help me with the higher levels of math I have to take for my degree. I think the
    biggest concern I have with this class is that it is online. Ive never taken a math class online.

    I am in the same boat here, although as much as I like the idea of math I kind of suck at it. It is tough taking
    math classes online but as long as you know we can use the textbook resources, Google the concepts, and look on
    OpenStack for even more resources, I think you will do well. Also we could email our professor!
