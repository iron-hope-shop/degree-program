        Hello, my name is Brad and I am 27 years old. I am the proud father of four children and proud husband to a
        beautiful wife. I currently work as an Advanced Systems Engineer in Information Security for Walmart Associates,
        Inc. I am enrolled in the bachelors program for computer science with a focus in cybersecurity. I am lucky to
        already have a job I would consider to be my dream job; however, in order to progress up the food chain and
        eventually buy a Ferrari, I have chosen to upskill. I took single variable caclulus in high school, did not take
        the AP test, and took it again in a different college. I make it a habit not to test out of math classes because
        I think it is very important to practice. I have also taken some statistics classes here at SNHU. I appreciate
        this opportunity to go over the fundamental concepts of mathematics because it has been a while. This course
        will assist me in my career path because I use algebra every day. I think the biggest concern or challenge for
        me in this course will be time management. I am not really worried about the content as much as I am excited!
