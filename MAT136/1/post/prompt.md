Hello, my name is Brad and I am 27 years old.  I am the proud father of four children and proud husband to a beautiful wife.  I currently work as an Advanced Systems Engineer in Information Security for Walmart Associates, Inc. I am enrolled in the bachelors program for computer science with a focus in cybersecurity. I am lucky to already have a job I would consider to be my dream job; however, in order to progress up the food chain and eventually buy a Ferrari, I have chosen to upskill.  I took single variable caclulus in high school, did not take the AP test, and took it again in a different college.  I make it a habit not to test out of math classes because I think it is very important to practice.  I have also taken some statistics classes here at SNHU.  I appreciate this opportunity to go over the fundamental concepts of mathematics because it has been a while.  This course will assist me in my career path because I use algebra every day.  I think the biggest concern or challenge for me in this course will be time management.  I am not really worried about the content as much as I am excited!
