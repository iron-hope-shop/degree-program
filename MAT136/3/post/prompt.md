For a certain company, the cost for producing x items is 45x+300 and the revenue for selling x items is 85xâˆ’0.5x^2.

C = 45x + 300
Where C is cost

R = 85x - 0.5x^2
Where R is revenue

P = R - C
Profit, P, is equal to revenue minus cost


Part a: Set up an expression for the profit from producing and selling x items. We assume that the company sells all of the items that it produces. (Hint: it is a quadratic polynomial.)

R - C = 85x - 0.5x^2 - 45x - 300
R - C = -0.5x^2 + 40x - 300

Part b: Find two values of x  that will create a profit of $300.

Solve for $300 profit
P = 300
R - C = 85x - 0.5x^2 - 45x - 300 = 300

Set equation equal to zero
0 = -0.5x^2 + 40x - 600
0 = ax^2 + bx + c

Subsititute using the quadratic equation
x = (-b +- sqrt((b^2)-4ac))/2a
x = (-40 +- sqrt((40^2)-4(-0.5)(-600)))/((2)(-0.5))
x = (-40 +- sqrt(1600-1200)))/(-1)
x = (-40 +- sqrt(400)))/(-1)
x = (-40 +- 20)/(-1)
x = 20,60

P = 300
R - C = 85x - 0.5x^2 - 45x - 300 = 15000

set equation equal to zero
0 = -0.5x^2 + 40x - 15300
0 = ax^2 + bx + c

Part c: Is it possible for the company to make a profit of $15,000?

Subsititute using the quadratic equation
x = (-b +- sqrt((b^2)-4ac))/2a
x = (-40 +- sqrt((40^2)-4(-0.5)(-15300)))/((2)(-0.5))
x = (-40 +- sqrt(1600-30600)/(-1)
x = (-40 +- (i)(sqrt(-29000))/(-1)

No, not a real number
