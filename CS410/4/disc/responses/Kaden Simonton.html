        ... the first step I take is to make sure I fully understand the problem.

        It seems like common sense but the ability to listen and understand to a stakeholder (project manager or end user, usually) is underrated.  Few people have developed this skill professionally, let alone in their personal life!  When you make applications at an enterprise level there are usually stakeholders and they are your customers!!  Too many developers come in with a predisposition such as, "scala|java|python|some architecture/stack SOLVES EVERY PROBLEM."  This is simply not true and we have to have an open mind at all times.

        I attempt to break it down into more manageable parts. I can do this by creating a flowchart of some kind to outline the structure and logic of the project. This aids in visualizing the project and the different components that go into it.

        The ability to break down problems into their simplest terms is also underrated.  The majority of junior (and even senior) developers lack this skill.  I was talking to a mentor of mine who claimed "he is not good at math" and he is the highest ranking engineer in his organizational unit.  Clearly he has some fundamental understanding of math.  He said he just breaks everything down into simplest terms and starts from there.  It is a good mantra to work by.  I also really like visuals and I suggest using emojis in your diagrams if you have not (rather than the logos/icons provided in tools like drawio).

        Then, I finally begin coding the individual components and being sure to test each one as I go along.

        So many people do not test products.  Please continue to do this even if it is the path of most resistance.  The same goes for application security.  It is often overlooked and is a very important aspect within any organization.
