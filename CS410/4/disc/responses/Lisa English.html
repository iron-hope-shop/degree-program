        It's good to know and understand the reason behind the coding project. What coding language and operating system would, I develop a design or project for, helps me know which direction to take. I've taken courses in the past where; I had no knowledge or experience working with a particular software. My first approach was look into outside resources, such as ordering books off Amazon to better understanding of the assignment. I enjoy reading but prefer an actually book in my hand. If a book is available to order, I will more than likely order the book or materials.

        This carries over to enterprise work as well but I would advise that while tools such as programming languages and operating systems are good to know, you certainly have to prioritize your focus when approaching a coding project.  The basis of a project should primarily be the business need and secondarily the platform on which it stands.  I know it is hard to temporarily ignore the wealth of technical knowledge we are being introduced to here at SNHU but regardless of the programming language, functionality is more important.  We need to start on simplest terms when approaching problems.  With very few exceptions, the performance of high level languages such as java, javascript, python, etc. are quickly converging.  This means that while there are traditional applications of certain programming languages, it is more and more possible to do the same implementation in another language.  Why is that significant?  We have many tools with which to solve the same problems.  So I would advise not to stress too much about different technologies and to dive deeper into javascript or python because when you fully understand it, it will be way less stressful and you can make decisions based on functionality.  That being said it is important to understand the reason we do what we do and a part of that is understanding code.  But that is (in my opinion) one of the later steps of professional development.  Sorry for the rant, hopefully that all makes sense in text as well as my head, and I made a bunch of assumptions but mean no harm!

        There is a book you should read called <a herf="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0137909101/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_w=Fzbl8&content-id=amzn1.sym.116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_p=116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_r=AKNJYXD1GCRQ213WJQRX&pd_rd_wg=ErVR5&pd_rd_r=a6388c59-b6b4-4bed-ba01-d99a9179ca15&pd_rd_i=0137909101&psc=1">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software (2nd Edition)</a> -- make sure to get the second edition if you do get it because it JUST came out in Q4 of last year.  The first edition was written in 1999 but this covers more and reads just like a book.  He takes you on a journey from morse code, to braille, to machine code, and finally assembly.
