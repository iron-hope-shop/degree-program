        The closest experience I have had with reversed engineering was taking apart my TV to study each of the
        components. Well, it turned out that the idea wasn't good because I couldn't piece it back together.

        I also struggle with reverse engineering hardware. I have taken our dryer apart twice and each time I ended up
        with spare parts... whoops. How do you pronounce your name? It is like Shawn, Sean, or ir it like Sion or Sian?

        In addition to what is explained in the video, I think assembly language is important to learn because it
        provides a greater level of control over the hardware and software of a computer system. It offers the ability
        to learn system behavior and to use it to optimize codes for speed and size.

        I am currently a systems engineer and hopefully this class can teach my how software reverse engineering applies
        to my work. It is very interesting and I would like to delve into theory at some point I just don't see the
        justification beyond this class. Also I did the assignment for this week and it was... mind bending. And that
        was for a simple application! I can't wait to dig in deeper because it is interesting; but at the same time, it
        is so immensely complicated.
