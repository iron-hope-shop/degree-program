        My name is Marcos Raymundo and I am currently pursuing a degree in software engineering. I currently have a bachelor's in accounting but discovered my passion for computer science when I started diving in building my personal computer and when I worked at a previous job closely with engineers.

        Hey Marcos!  I can certainly relate; however, I suck at accounting.  I majored in business administration for a couple of years before changing my major.  It is certainly never too late to switch to compsci especially if it is your passion.  I wish you luck on your journey.

        This could help with less rewrites of the code which in turn would cost less money and provide a more efficient process so it can be important that a developer learns assembly language.

        Perhaps if you can see the matrix this the case but after just doing the first assignment my mind is exploded and re-exploded.  Things like re-writes or "tech debt" are not high enough on my priority list to whip out gcc (or equivalent) and start reverse engineering an app.

        One other useful thing about knowing assembly language is that it can help you understand how fast the code is operating so this would be handy if you need to make every bit of code matter which might not be often nowadays but it might be better to know in the event you do need it.

        Agreed.  I think the point of this class is to appreciate the process of compilers and cpu architecture but realize things like this probably only apply on business-critical objectives like creating an entirely new financial platform or reverse engineering some monolithic app that serves as the backbone of the business.  For 99% of problems, performance can be achieved by tweaking the algos you are using.  If you are trying to get that last 1ms, though, yeah this is the stuff which will get you there.
