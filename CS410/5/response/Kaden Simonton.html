        First of all, I do not think I mentioned this before but your name is awesome, it's actually my son's middle name as well!

        Hackers were able to gain access to every single user that had an account with them. In total, 4 individuals were responsible for the attack and they used spam messages and individual attacks to gain access to their systems. The incident wasn't even detected until 2016 when people's accounts were found on the dark web for sale which then prompted a more broad investigation.

        The article did not go into much depth about the method of attack but some light Googling suggests the attacker was able to spoof a cookie and auth as other users.  This sort of attack is known as session hijacking.  Web application security is a passion of mine, I am <a href="https://www.giac.org/certified-professional/Brad-Jackson/201928">GIAC GWEB</a> certified.  I would say the reverse engineering in this scenario would be more of an introspective or philosphical look at the high-level code the application was running on.  Using time-based, signed, tokens such as JWTs or even drastically reducing keepalive times could help mitigate this sort of attack.
