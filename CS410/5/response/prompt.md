# What would you add to their claims?
The article did not go into much depth about the method of attack but some light Googling suggests the attacker was able to spoof a cookie and auth as other users.  This sort of attack is known as session hijacking.  Web application security is a passion of mine, I am <a href="https://www.giac.org/certified-professional/Brad-Jackson/201928">GIAC GWEB</a> certified.  I would say the reverse engineering in this scenario would be more of an introspective or philosphical look at the high-level code the application was running on.  Using time-based, signed, tokens such as JWTs or even drastically reducing keepalive times could help mitigate this sort of attack.
# Are there other security measures that could be taken?

# What more can be learned from the incident described?

# Are their additional ways to perform reverse engineering to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future?
