        Proper security measure include the basics of using your work computer solely for work and making sure personal information and data is encrypted. There was even a group of 60 professionals that laid out a framework to counter ransomware with more cooperation from the government and more cryptocurrency market regulations. To prevent this incident from occurring in the future, users need to focus on the right usage of work technology and  greater vigilance when sending and receiving sensitive data.

        Unfortunately not much can be done with regards to retrieving the data from an ransomware attack and most companies will not pay the ransom anymore.  So it's great that MPD did try to pay it.  Most organizations have insurance for that and employees kind of suffer at the hand of that... Well, on a more positive note it could certainly have been prevented in the first place.  I can not find where article goes into detail about the attack vector but it was probably an insecure email server or phishing.  I agree with what you said about preading awareness, every company should have an internal phishing campaign to keep employees on their toes and reward any steps taken to report such attacks.
