        I had to tone this down. Don't hate me. I think the title of "full-stack developer" is a title few are worthy of. To be clear I am not a hater, more of an elitist, but when people say they are "full stack developers" I expect a lot from them.

        My name is Brad Jackson (29). I have architected and implemented many world-scale applications for a Fortune 5 company. These applications require near 100% uptime and the apps I built have zero downtime. My magnum opus was creating the security system that hires, fires, transfers, etc. for this Fortune 1 company. I started programming when I was 13. I am currently spearheading my startup. I began my career in information systems in 2018. I left as a senior engineer with no degree (I will in July!) but I have GIAC certs.

        Very few people I have ever met to be full-stack developers. Many claim to be. The way to stand out is if you can justify the budget, tech stack, business use case, and more. Knowing what combination of systems, OS, baremetal, hypervisor, or containerization/serverless is such an important but small part of full-stack development. However, full-stack development is more than outlining and planning. It is about execution, about being a pioneer, a leader, an accountant, and more. It is about making a product that is available and does its job.

        I have personal projects on three VPCs (virtual private cloud) that have different stacks for a reason. Don't be intimidated even if you have to Google (or ask ChatGPT) EVERYTHING. You might start Googling 100% but like anything else the more you practice, the less you will have to Google. It also will force you to think about the "why" engineers do what they do. If all the hundreds or thousands of decisions you have made add up to a functional project, you are farther along that most professionals I have met. Sad but true.
