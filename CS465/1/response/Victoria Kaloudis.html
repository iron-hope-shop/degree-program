        HTML, while simple, can be the gateway to more complex programming concepts and full-stack development. Your previous encounter with HTML in a lab setting provides a solid foundation to build upon. Hopefully you are correct and this course is less stressful. It might offer the clarity and focus you need.

        While you might not apply MEAN to your day-to-day, the knowledge is valuable and transferrable, especially as you consider transitioning into data science. Stack Overflow is great. But, don't underestimate official docs and projects. They solidify your learning.
