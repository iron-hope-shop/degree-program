        It's great to meet you and learn about your journey in the tech field. As a father and a professional, your commitment to advancing your education is commendable. Like you, I'm diving deeper into full-stack development. I aim to build on my foundation in the field.

        You have management experience. You also have a strong computer science background. These make you well-suited to tackle this course's advanced topics. I have experience in designing applications for high-stakes environments. It has taught me the value of adaptability and continuous learning. These traits seem to match your approach well.

        For resources you could learn a different stack than this course (MEAN) and you could try to deploy a react app or something on GCP. AWS and Azure suck (overall and in terms of cloud IAM). Everything I learned I learned by doing. I suck at following instructions. Once you do it a few times it will be old hat and you can move to the next thing that perplexes you!
