At the start of this course, it is important to familiarize yourself with your classmates, the learning outcomes of our course, and our course environment. This will help you build a plan and support system to successfully complete your assignments. For this discussion, review the course syllabus and our course outcomes and then create a post that addresses the following topics:  
  
1. Provide a short introduction of yourself to your peers and instructor. What personal or professional experiences have you encountered that are related to the general topics of this course?
2. After reviewing the course outcomes, what do these outcomes mean to you? How are these outcomes relevant to your own personal/professional experiences and interests?
3. After reviewing the course syllabus and the assignment guidelines for your Module One activities, what resources will you need in order to be successful in this course? How can your instructor and fellow classmates help you reach the outcomes of the course?

I had to tone this down. Don't hate me. I think the title of "full-stack developer" is a title few are worthy of. To be clear I am not a hater, more of an elitist, but when people say they are "full stack developers" I expect a lot from them.

My name is Brad Jackson (29). I have architected and implemented many world-scale applications for a Fortune 5 company. These applications require near 100% uptime and the apps I built have zero downtime. My magnum opus was creating the security system that hires, fires, transfers, etc. for this Fortune 1 company. I started programming when I was 13. I am currently spearheading my startup. I began my career in information systems in 2018. I left as a senior engineer with no degree (I will in July!) but I have GIAC certs.

Very few people I have ever met to be full-stack developers. Many claim to be. The way to stand out is if you can justify the budget, tech stack, business use case, and more. Knowing what combination of systems, OS, baremetal, hypervisor, or containerization/serverless is such an important but small part of full-stack development. However, full-stack development is more than outlining and planning. It is about execution, about being a pioneer, a leader, an accountant, and more. It is about making a product that is available and does its job.

I have personal projects on three VPCs (virtual private cloud) that have different stacks for a reason. Don't be intimidated even if you have to Google (or ask ChatGPT) EVERYTHING. You might start Googling 100% but like anything else the more you practice, the less you will have to Google. It also will force you to think about the "why" engineers do what they do. If all the hundreds or thousands of decisions you have made add up to a functional project, you are farther along that most professionals I have met. Sad but true.

Hello everyone,

My name is Carlos and I work as a manager at a Walmart distribution center in Florida. I am a father to three daughters and a husband to my wife. As a worker in the IT department, I know my way around computers and have experience in the tech field through my previous education at SNHU working towards my bachelor's in Computer Science.

Through my classes I have dabbled in many different program styles and have worked on websites in the past, however after looking at the course objectives and assignments I have realized that this class takes my previous education to the next level. I'm excited to learn more about web pages and how to combine a database using frameworks since that was a skill I have struggled with in the past. Full stack development overall I do not have much confidence in however, overall I am excited to expand on my education and learn more about full stack development!

Regarding resources, I expect to google things or ask for more information. For assignments, I will need to give myself time to understand the materials and complete the assignments correctly. Other than those, discussion posts and instructor feedback will help me become more informed on our topics and correct anything that I may have misunderstood or just give me a new perspective on the materials.
