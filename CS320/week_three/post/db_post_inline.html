        Requirements are important because outlining various types of requirements is what defines your software. It
        also helps other people to understand your vision which enables them to contribute.

        The stage I feel is most important in regard to requirements is requirement elicitation. Requirement elicitation
        is at the heart of the process of designing an application. If you do not identify and outline the requirements
        from relevant stakeholders, your application will be pointless. Always make yourself available to hear the needs
        of your customers and do not be afraid of having "too many" meetings. There is no such thing, especially when
        you are engineering a complex system.

        I am fairly experienced in working with consumers' requirements. An example would be the automation of
        onboarding processes. Obstacles I faced when designing and implementing one of these systems were the massive
        amount of detail. Every time I spoke with someone about what were we doing, it seemed like we were adding
        another requirement. Even after the system was deployed into production we were figuring out ways it needed to
        be fine-tuned. The problem we faced was that we only had two engineers working on the project and we did not
        realize the scale. We designed, tested, implemented, over and over. The product eventually succeeded in doing
        what we intended it to do but there were months and months of planning, trial, and error. It is a rough path we
        have chosen but the rewards are great.
