# Why are requirements important?
Requirements are important because outlining various types of requirements is what defines your software.  It also helps other people to understand your vision which enables them to contribute.

# Which stage do you feel is most important in regard to requirements (requirement elicitation, analysis, design, implementation)? Explain.
The stage I feel is most important in regard to requirements is requirement elicitation.  Requirement elicitation is at the heart of the process of designing an application.  If you do not identify and outline the requirements from relevant stakeholders, your application will be pointless.  Always make yourself available to hear the needs of your customers and do not be afraid of having "too many" meetings.  There is no such thing, especially when you are engineering a complex system.

# What is your experience level working with consumers' requirements?
I am fairly experienced in working with consumers' requirements.  An example would be the automation of onboarding processes.  Obstacles I faced when designing and implementing one of these systems were the massive amount of detail.  Every time I spoke with someone about what were we doing, it seemed like we were adding another requirement.  Even after the system was deployed into production we were figuring out ways it needed to be fine-tuned.  The problem we faced was that we only had two engineers working on the project and we did not realize the scale.  We designed, tested, implemented, over and over.  The product eventually succeeded in doing what we intended it to do but there were months and months of planning, trial, and error.  It is a rough path we have chosen but the rewards are great.

# If you have experience, describe any obstacles you have run into or any positive experiences you have had.


# If you do not have experience, what are some questions you may have for your peers in order to effectively understand a consumer's requirements?
