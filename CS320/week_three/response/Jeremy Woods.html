        I believe the most important stage regarding requirements is requirement elicitation. If the gathering of
        requirements is not thorough and well understood, then any later analysis, design, and implementation may not
        fulfil what the system was meant to do.

        I agree that requirement elicitation is the most important stage. It is definately fundamental in understanding
        the use cases for a product.

        my question would be to those with actual on the job experience would be what was the most effective way to
        gather requirements?

        In my experience, the most effective way to gather requirements is by first understanding the environment within
        which you are working. After that, you will be able to better understand stakeholders' requirements. Once you
        have that basic understanding, it is important to hold as many meetings as it takes in order to answer all of
        the foreseeable questions you might have. Of course it is also important to have others from your team join
        these meetings and remember that if you have questions in the future to reach back out to the stakeholders.
