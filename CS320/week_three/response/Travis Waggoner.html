        The most important I feel is the analysis because this is what will tell you have to correct or need more
        information for. I work in customer service and repair/build and my experience with requirements is extremely
        high.

        I chose requirement elicitation as the most important stage. I can see how analysis is important. I have also
        served time in customer service answering phone calls and troubleshooting on-prem server issues. I think,
        though, that we are looking at the process from different perspectives. You are talking more from a point of
        post SDLC, granted it is cyclical, which would be more of an ongoing maintenance/upkeep phase rather than
        product design and implmentation.
