    The Role of Testing in the Software Development Life Cycle

    During the testing stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), software is evaluated from various aspects to
    ensure it is operating according to the design specifications and other criteria. Product defects are reported if
    they do not align with the functional or visual business needs. These defects are then reported, recorded,
    monitored, fixed, and retested. This stage will last until the product meets the specifications as outlined in the
    software design document.

    The testing stage is vital to a successful SDLC because it ensures the delivery of a complete and working product.
    If properly executed, it also means that maintenance will be easier for future engineers. Layering different types
    of testing and emphasizing the layers which apply most to the system are also crucial for a successful product.

    There are some exceptions in which the testing stage would occur earlier or later than it typically does in the
    SDLC. For example, unit testing may occur during the building phase when prototypes are being actively created. This
    is commonly done to ensure the product is functioning at a basic level and to reduce technical debt. Testing can
    also occur after it typically does during the SDLC if there is a production-breaking change which requires a new
    functionality. In this case, testing would be done in an expedited manner.
