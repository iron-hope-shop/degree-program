# What occurs during the testing stage of the SDLC?
During the testing stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), software is evaluted from various aspects to ensure it is operating according to the design specifications and other criteria.  Product defects are reported if they do not align with the functional or visual business needs.  These defects are then reported, recorded, monitored, fixed, and retested.  This stage will last until the product meets the specifications as outlined in the software design document.

# Why is the testing stage vital to a successful SDLC?
The testing stage is vital to a successful SDLC because it ensures the delivery of a complete and working product.  If properly executed, it also means that maintenance will be easier for future engineers.  Layering different types of testing and emphasizing the layers which apply most to the system are also crucial for a successful product.

# Are there any exceptions in which the testing stage would occur earlier or later than it typically does in the SDLC? Explain.
There are some exceptions in which the testing stage would accur earlier or later than it typically does in the SDLC.  For example, unit testing may occur during the building phase when prototypes are being actively created.  This is commonly done to ensure the product is functioning at a basic level and to reduce technical debt.  Testing can also occur after it typically does during the SDLC if there is a production-breaking change which requires a new functionality.  In this case, testing would be done in an expedited manner.
