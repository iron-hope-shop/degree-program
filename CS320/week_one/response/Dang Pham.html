        From the reading, software professionals test their code often and throughout the entire process of writing
        code.

        In theory this sounds easy and true, right? I have an experience I would like to share with you on this matter.
        I was working on an application which consisted of several Spring Boot Java microservices. Myself and two other
        engineers had tasks for testing these services at various layers of the stack. Long story short, I was the only
        one who successfully completed testing and because of that I had to do a lot of extra work fixing what they did
        not test to begin with. Isn't that crazy? These individuals had Bachelor's Degrees in computer science. The
        takeaway here is that if your team does not recognize the importance of testing then they are mislead and some
        one will have to pay the piper. It sounds like extra work to do all of this testing, especially if the
        application is complex; however, if you cut corners the work will increase, albeit later in the process, by
        magnitudes. Unfortunately this does not just happen during the testing phase in SDLC nor does it only happen in
        technology. This is really a microcosm of working for any company.
