        I think proper functional AND non-functional testing will make me a better developer because I believe my
        reputation as a developer is at stake with the deployment of a piece of software, so I would want the end user
        to have the best experience possible.

        This is the right mentality to have. Two things that few people in the field recognize are that: you create a
        product suited for a user not suited for yourself, and that testing is important. So many times someone will try
        to "improve" an application either functionally or non-functionally which we then have to roll back because it
        is not what the customer wanted. This extra work could easily be avoided. Testing, and I said this in my other
        response to Mr. Dang Pham, is a very important and often overlooked stage of SDLC. Adults... with degrees... who
        have worked in software development for 5+ years... often neglect to do testing. It is important to recognize
        that some testing is more involved. If your application is very complex with many integrations of outside
        systems, testing will be very hard. It is ALWAYS more work to to go back and fix something (sometimes when the
        application is running in production it will cost the business money and you a raise/promo) rather than address
        it during the testing phase.
