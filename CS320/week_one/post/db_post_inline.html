    Hello, my name is Brad. I am the proud father of three children and proud husband to a beautiful wife. I currently
    work as a Systems Engineer III in Information Security for Walmart Associates, Inc. I am enrolled in the bachelors
    program for computer science with a focus in cybersecurity. I am lucky to already have a job I would consider to be
    my dream job; however, in order to progress up the food chain and eventually buy a Ferrari, I have chosen to
    upskill.

    I ensure that my software and programs are correct by taking advantage of my IDE's (I prefer VSCode) linters and
    constantly debugging. Once deployed I also test in a development environment before I deploy to production. In
    software meant for larger, distributed, systems it is also preferable to create automated end-to-end testing.
    Software professionals test their code locally, some have integrations in CI/CD pipelines, and UI/feature testing in
    dev. The meet requirements by following specs provided by senior engineers and ASKING FOR HELP when there are
    uncertainties.

    These strategies have helped me as a developer by ensuring that the vision of a certain product was carried on
    throughout its development lifecycle. Of course, it is organization and role specific which method of planning and
    communication works best for your team but there are universal guidelines (some of which I mentioned).

    My experiences developing clean, correct, code have been numerous. The most testing I ever had to do on a project
    was when I was building and application with a senior engineer which was meant to automate account creation,
    termination, etc. for our company. I wrote unit tests, automated these tests via our CI/CD pipeline, integration
    testing, and UI/feature testing. I also had several platforms which were involved in the project so this testing
    extended to those platforms as well. One of them was ServiceNow, if anyone is familiar with that!

    The value of testing is that you won't get fired. You should test everything you create extensively, submit it for
    review to your peers, and fix/test for the bugs they found. Just test! It enables you to continue working which is a
    fundamental building block for any sort of professional growth. :)
