    After doing some reading, I find Jenkins to be one that I would like to learn more about. It is currently one of the
    leading open source continuous integration tools.

    Jenkins is definitely a well-established CI/CD platform. I am honestly not sure how someone would go about learning
    about Jenkins without their own deployment. From what I understand, maintaining a Jenkins deployment is a pain.
    Buddy may be the better option if they have an open sandbox environment where you can try different
    configurations/tutorials without having to set up a whole server of your own.
