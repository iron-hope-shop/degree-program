        I have, however, used the version control tool Git in some of my hobby development; the application of tools
        like CircleCI or GitHub Actions seems pretty apparent to me.

        I did not even think to add GitHub to my post. It really is vital... pretty much all of my company's CI/CD
        relies on that initial webhook from github. We use configuration files like YML/YAML in our repos which trigger
        webhooks for a Jenkins-based CI/CD platform. It is pretty cool; however, there are many types of configuration
        YAMLs and too much customization can lead to confusion for future supporters of your app.
