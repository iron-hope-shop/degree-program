        I am familiar with continuous integration tools such as Jenkins. I am not a master at writing jobs for Jenkins.
        My company uses several modified versions of Jenkins which they have renamed and most of the process is
        automated based on your target platform. Of course, you can customize these automated jobs; however, why
        reinvent the wheel? We mostly use templates which are fine-tuned and then the CI/CD pipeline scans, builds, and
        deploys your application.

        Unfortunately, I did not architect any of our CI/CD systems and they are highly modified for our environment so
        I doubt my process is very similar to that of deploying, admining, and using Jenkins. I guess similarities are
        creating my own Dockerfiles and app configs/yamls. I would like to learn more about Jenkins but I doubt I could
        apply it to my area. It would be good to have in my toolbelt.
