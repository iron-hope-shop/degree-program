        Static testing is a way of testing software without executing any of the code within the project. The advantage
        of static testing is that it can be conducted during the beginning of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
        This technique finds the point of failure rather than the root cause of failure. Typically, the root cause of
        failure would be found during test execution. This saves money and time.

        Dynamic testing is a method of testing software used to validate the behavior of a program. These tests are
        often conducted with artificial data to find weak points of the software. An example of this would be load
        testing. Another example would be using randomly-generated data as in input for a web-based API. Dynamic testing
        requires the software to be executable or complete.

        The differences between static and dynamic testing are the techniques used, the purpose of testing, and the
        phase of the SDLC it is conducted. Dynamic testing will simulate the execution or use of the software with real
        or simulated data. Static testing requires no inputs. The purpose of static testing is to catch errors before
        code execution and further development. Dynamic testing is intended to test the validity of a completed product.
        Static testing can occur much earlier in the SDLC than dynamic testing and can mitigate much more initial
        damage. Despite these differences, these methods complement each other. It is important to use both static and
        dynamic testing. Employing both during SDLC will ensure that your application is more reliable, secure, and
        scalable.
