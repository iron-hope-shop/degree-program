# What is static testing?
Static testing is a way of testing software without executing any of the code within the project.  The advantage of static testing is that it can be conducted during the beginning of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).  This technique finds the point of failure rather than the root cause of failure.  Typically, the root cause of failure would be found during test execution.  This saves money and time.

# What is dynamic testing?
Dynamic testing is a method of testing software used to validate the behavior of a program.  These tests are often conducted with artifical data to find weak points of the software.  Dynamic testing requires the software be executable or complete.

# What are the differences between static and dynamic testing?
The differences between static and dynamic testing are the techniques used, the purpose of testing, and the phase of the SDLC it is conducted.  Dynamic testing will simulate the execution or use of the software with real or simulated data.  Static testing requires no inputs.  The purpose of static testing is to catch errors before code execution and futher development.  Dynamic testing is intended to test the validity of a completed product.  Static testing can occur much earlier in the SDLC than dynamic testing and can mitigate much more initial damage.  Despite these differences, these methods compliment eachother.  It is important to use both static and dynamic testing.  Employing both during SDLC will ensure that your application is more reliable, secure, and scalable.
