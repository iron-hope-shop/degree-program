        Multiple patches have been released to fix the original vulnerability as well as additional vulnerabilities that
        have arisen. From what I've read about this, the consensus seems to be that this was a design flaw. The coders
        did not anticipate their code being used in this malicious way and it appears they did not test it for
        unintended uses.

        First of all, this made for a horrible end-of-year for my department. It really was a scramble. The
        possibilities of this vulnerability are pretty much endless; however, I think it could have been prevented
        initially with a better validation pattern... obviously Apache was able to deploy a patch to fix it so I agree
        that more testing should have been done.
