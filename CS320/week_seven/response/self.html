    Unfortunately, in terms of effects, there may be no way to financially recover from an event like this. The best
    path forward should be to identify root cause and establish a system of double-checking and prevention of errors
    such as this one. Another life lesson from this is that sometimes you have to cut your losses. If you have to
    discontinue a project and move on to another strategy it is not a shameful thing to do.
