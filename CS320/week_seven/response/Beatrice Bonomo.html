        In 2003, a hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan erroneously pronounced 8,500 of its patients dead. According to
        the article, a patient software update incorrectly converted patient codes from "discharged" to "expired". This
        error resulted in patients, insurance companies, and government entities receiving notice of patient deaths,
        causing a lapse in insurance coverage and social security benefits for thousands of people.

        This is both hilarious and sad. I immediately wondered about the insurance implications... do you think anyone
        tried to roll with it and proceed with a fraudulent claim? If there were ever an opportunity to fake your death
        and move to Mexico this would be it! Maybe Canada because it is closer. Anyway, this could possibly be avoided
        with better input validation or perhaps a system of checks and balances within the hospital's clerical
        department... the article says it was caused by one digit being dropped and that it only took a few days to fix;
        however, I truly wonder how easy it is to convince other government agencies and insurance companies to revive
        the dead.
