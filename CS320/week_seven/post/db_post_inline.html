        The incident I have chosen to write about is the Knight Capital Group (KCG) rogue trading algorithm. KCG created
        software called Smart Market Access Routing System (SMARS) which was designed to route stock trading orders.
        This system replaced their older one, Power Peg. Power Peg had been decomissioned 9 years prior; however, on
        August 1, 2012, SMARS triggered a Power Peg job which in turn began making trades in an infinite loop. This
        caused an approximate $440 million in losses, dropped their stock price by 90%, and eventually led to an
        acquisition of the company. The release of these details caused highly-valued clients such as TD Ameritrade,
        Vanguard, and Fidelity Investments to stop using their API and thus lost their business. Scott Skyrm said it
        best,

        The failure is manifested in the fact that they didn't have a kill switch in place. It could have been a very
        simple algorithmic expression for a programmer to write: IF the daily volume reaches a certain level, THEN shut
        it down.
