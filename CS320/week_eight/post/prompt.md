# How is software automation improving efficiency?
Software automation is making the entire pipeline of software development more efficient by reducing the amount of repetitive tasks needed.  This takes the form of writing unit tests which will be reused.  Another example of early testing methods is load testing via locust or even VSC/Postman.  This drastically reduces the amount of guessing and work involved when developing projects such as web applications.  Software automation also shows up in CI/CD pipeline infrastructure in the form of automated build tools, scanning tools, and deployment tools.  These are usually configured by systems engineers rathers than software engineers but the effect is the same.  The implications which software automation has for quality engineers is numerous and includes pros and cons.  With all of this automation in place, it is possible to make templates for software engineers to follow in order to produce consistent products; however, this comes with the caveats of requiring a support team for those templates/platforms.  Another item which is a pro and a con of software automation is the abstraction of low level software layers away from engineers.  When boilerplate code is written for them, software engineers meet different expectations and get further away from the metal/configuration.  This could potentially introduce security flaws if there is not a dedicated security team.
