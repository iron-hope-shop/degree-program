        The one con I can think of is that by over-relying on software automation developers may still leave some errors
        behind that aren't functionality-related. Such errors would include user interface design, speed of potential
        server-client interaction, and security flaws. Although the tests for security could be automated, I think that
        those tests would still have to be written by hired hackers who could probably hack the program more efficiently
        through human interaction than through testing.

        It is very important to validate test coverage yourself. I think it will be a long time before we can tell a
        machine learning model the functional and non-functional requirements for a project and it write all of the
        tests. That being said there are certainly ways to automate UI (like on a mobile app) tests and they are usually
        integrated in CI/CD pipelines. Also it is important to note that most companies have a pen testing team which
        can range from basic testing (for internal solutions) to rigourous pen testing (for external-facing solutions).
