# highlight any other ways that software automation may improve efficiency or change the field of software development

The one con I can think of is that by over-relying on software automation developers may still leave some errors behind that aren't functionality-related. Such errors would include user interface design, speed of potential server-client interaction, and security flaws. Although the tests for security could be automated, I think that those tests would still have to be written by hired hackers who could probably hack the program more efficiently through human interaction than through testing.

It is very important to validate test coverage yourself.  I think it will be a long time before we can tell a machine learning model the functional and non-functional requirements for a project and it write all of the tests.  That being said there are certainly ways to automate UI (like on a mobile app) tests and they are usually integrated in CI/CD pipelines.  Also it is important to note that most companies have a pen testing team which can range from basic testing (for internal solutions) to rigourous pen testing (for external-facing solutions).
