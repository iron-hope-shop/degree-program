        I referenced Guido in my initial post but it seems like even he cannot make up his mind about the "scripting versus programming" wars.  Based on my own personal experience, I have only ever built on top of existing frameworks like Flask.  Why reinvent the wheel, right?  I prefer higher level use cases for Python.  For me it is the blood that feeds the moving parts of my application.  But like many things, Python gets as low-level as you want.  So would you consider C extensions with CPython programming?
