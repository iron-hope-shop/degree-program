        I would say Python is a scripting language whose versatility has been extended into a programming language through the introduction of numerous frameworks, modules and libraries. Many applications have been created or components of them are using Python. Examples I found include but are not limited to Spotify, Reddit and Industrial Light & Magic (Lucasfilm).

        Based on 90% of the posts from this week it seems like a lot of people are on the fence.  I agree that Python is a scripting language that has its fingers in a lot of pies.  It is hard to have a large-scale production applications that run solely on Python.  For example, even a developer creating a simple dynamic website would be hard-pressed to do it all using Python.  From my experience, Vue.js and React are currently the most popular Javascript frameworks used for dynamic websites.  There are some libraries like Vue.py that try to make it easy for users to create Python objects that control the DOM but they are not quite there yet.  I think we are moving toward a time where Javascript and Python will share a position at the top of "most used programming languages" despite both being classified as scripting languages.
