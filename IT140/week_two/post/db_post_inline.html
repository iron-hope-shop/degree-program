        Programming and scripting languages are closely tied together. Programming languages are typically low-level
        languages meant for architecting systems while scripting languages are used to link systems together and
        maintain them. It is a heated topic of debate but I have changed my opinion on the subject. Python is built with
        a low-level language, C. It is interpreted, rather than compiled. Python is a powerful, high-level, scripting
        language. I say this begrudgingly because I am familiar with production applications that are built on top of
        Python.

        System programming languages were designed for building data structures and algorithms from scratch, starting
        from the most primitive computer elements such as words of memory. In contrast, scripting languages are designed
        for gluing: They assume the existence of a set of powerful components and are intended primarily for connecting
        components

        Guido Van Rossum is the creator of Python. In the foreword of the first O'Reilly Python book he refers to Python
        as "the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately" (Rossum, 1996). This is concrete evidence that
        Python was initially created as a scripting language. Despite
        "not [being] the fastest running scripting language," Python is the foundation for web applications such as
        Flask, machine learning, and batch jobs. The flexibility of Python is what makes it hard to justifiably call it
        either a programming or a scripting language.

        On the contrast, Kopec states that "Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world"
        (Kopec, 2018). While Python is popular, the claim that it is a programming language is bold. Kopec's opinion is
        strongly stated whereas, if we continue reading Rossum's manifesto, Rossum is divided. He boasts that "Python is
        remarkably free from many of the hang-ups of conventional programming languages," unaware that he is claiming
        that Python lives in a dual state (Rossum, 1996).

        Python has ascended since its inception. It was originally cast as a scripting language; however, it has evolved
        into a pro-script-gramming language. It is useful for patching together applications as well as rote server
        maintenance.
