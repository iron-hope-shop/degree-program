        This was not possible with Lua, but with Python (and Jython, a Java implementation of Python), the development team was able to fulfill this client's request. Because each airport and air traffic control situation is unique, a special version of their software is developed for each client. Following the development of the Python special version of their ATC software, the team began to rewrite the tools for all of their previous clients in Python.

        I enjoyed your choice for the topic of your post.  I have always been led to believe that air traffic control is highly complicated and it is impressive that they were able to refactor their infrastructure in Python.

        In addition to resolving all of these issues by switching to Python, Frequentis was also able to reduce the number of lines of code to 5000 lines, half as much as was necessary using Lua. What's more, the change reduced the amount of time required to code the software for new clients to one-third what was required in Lua.

        It seems to be a trend throughout the discussion posts that Python can be used for quickly standing up infrastructure.  Using builtin operators like "not in", f-strings, list comprehensions, or ".join()" makes Python code very short.  For me it is a lot like writing psuedo-code and feels almost like I am writing a paper.  The good news is that it's hard to get writer's block when you are using Python to accomplish something.
