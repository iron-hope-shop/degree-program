        Most of my work experience has been in the educational world, so I chose to explore how Python has influenced the educational industry. In my findings, I discovered that Python was used to create the educational technology known as the Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi has had a huge impact in educational technology for people young and old, as raspberrypi.org states, “Learning Python with Raspberry Pi doesn’t presuppose any computer knowledge . . .” The open format operating system and easy-to-use hardware controls makes the Raspberry Pi the ideal little machine for learning programming.

        I have been experimenting with micropython recently, specifically with the ESP8266 microchip.  Despite having a couple Raspberry Pi's sitting on the shelf for a few years I have never used them for learning Python.  I love the minimalism of these devices.  For some reason the cheaper, smaller, microchips seem a lot more practical to me than the fully-fledged computer that comes in the form of a Pi; however, I recently acquired a Raspberry Pi Zero W which I think will be less of a pain to use.  Although it is bigger than the ESP8266, I doubt development will be such a pain.  With the micopython devices you have to keep flashing firmware.

        It is difficult for me to imagine what my understanding of computers and programming would be like if I had this sort of technology at my disposal at a younger age. I can only imagine what sort of amazing things my future children and other future generations will create while they are still in grade school.

        I feel the same way.  Undoubtedly we would have ruled the world.  It's not too late!
