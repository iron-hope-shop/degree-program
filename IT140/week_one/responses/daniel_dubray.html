        I read that Python is a good first course for new people wanting to learn code so thatâ€™s a huge bonus for me I believe.  Since this course is basically like the groundwork for software engineering (in my opinion at least) this class will be huge for everything that is going to come from my degree. Since I have never actually put a lot of time and effort into learning to code, I am probably the most excited I have ever been to learn something like this or learn anything in general.

        In my opinion, Python is a great language for most applications.  There are some cases where compute performance could be better but you can just use a module like Cython or Cpython.  If you are wanting to get more familiar with the jargon used in software engineering I recommend listening to podcasts.  It is a great way to get familiar with the modern landscape and hear about what companies and idividuals are using in production environments as well as dev.  "Talk Python To Me," "Python Bytes," and "Software Engineering Daily" are a few great ones that I listen to weekly.  I hope you enjoy the class and the subject!
