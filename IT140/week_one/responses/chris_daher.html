    While i don't plan to become a full-on programmer I can tell you from my experience, having scripting knowledge is imperative to being a high level technician or in my case required for becoming a System's Administrator.

        I currently work on a L2 helpdesk!  The importance of automation is clear all the way from ops to dev and I completely agree that it benefits both system and software engineers.

        I think my biggest challenge for this course will be not crossing  languages, thankfully most modern languages use a similar syntax, and hopefully the IDE will yell at me.

        Codio will certainly yell at you.  I have used VS Code for the longest time so I usually brainstorm in there and move it to Codio; although, sometimes the inputs that Codio is wanting are not clear.

        Python is an extremely powerful language. Eve-online, a sandbox style MMORPG is written entirely in python, which also causes its biggest restriction, multiple cores. Python can be made to work with multiple cores but usually operates much better on a single core due to latency.

        Interesting.  I did not know that Eve was built on Python.  The problem you are referring to is how the interpreter locks threads, known as the GIL.  I doubt we are going to get into it, but you can check out the <strong>asyncio</strong> module in PyPI.  It is tricky to learn but once you get the hang of using it, multithreading is very much possible.  There are a few packages I have used that also import asyncio, like slack-client (for making Slack Bots).
