        I am Brad.  I am twenty-five years old.  I hail from the not-so-mean streets of Sugar Land, Texas.  I spent most of my life there.  My first college experience was at Sam Houston State University where I studied Banking and Financial Institutions.  I did not finish my degree.  I moved to Northwest Arkansas and began working in information technology at the Wal-Mart home office.  I have had one prior semester of online learning prior to this.

        My professional experience varies; however, I have a focus in technology.  I deal with application and infrastructure teams daily.  This has allowed me to gain insight on the small moving parts between development, operations, and functional product.  I have experience with Python, which I began using about three years ago.  I have deployed production applications using Python and I am excited for this refresher.

        This course will ultimately contribute to my career goals by providing me with some collegiate experience with Python.  I think that a refresher is always a great thing, especially when I get college credits for it!  I hope to employ my current Python knowledge to the exercises to the best of my ability.

        I strongly disagree with Python being demoted to a "scripting" language.  I know that the foundations of YouTube and Instagram were built on Python and Instagram still uses Django.  While most of the tooling I use for server administration are in Python, the sky is the limit.  I hope that my peers who have not dabbled in programming realize the true value of Python as a toolbelt for getting things done.

        P.S. If you are wanting to format your posts more easily (in my opinion), check out the templates I made. They were created with inline CSS because were originally made for Blackboard at my previous university.  I will refine them more for this platform when I have time.
