        It is important to know how to use regular expressions (regex).  Regex is a tool that can be both strictly and loosely used.  For example, my initial script included the word boundary "\b" when it really did not need it.  I have changed the script to reflect that this is not needed.  There is certainly more than one way to search a pattern using regex.

        I use regex in nearly every project I create at work because I deal with output from unix/linux servers.   When parsing through CSV files that are missing columns and cannot be accurately read using another library, re pulls through.  My favorite use case was parsing through a giant CSV file of server owners and using regex to search for email addresses.  This saved a lot of time that we normally spent collecting these emails when reaching out to server owners.
