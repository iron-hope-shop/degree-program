        For example if we were to be at school for an event like track and we needed the school name next to the activities that are being competed in, in this scenario we would use dictionaries. Or like the example in the book with the gamer example.

        An inventory system for a game is a great example!  I must have missed this in whatever reading you are referring to.  We would probably have to use both dictionaries and lists to have an advanced inventory system for a game.
