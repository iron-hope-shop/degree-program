        If they were to mess up that order on even one patients, then when they go to retrieve the information it wouldn't be in the correct spot. However, if they were to use a dictionary instead, they would be able to assign the information to different keys like name, address, phone number, etc. They would not have to memorize which order it was in or anything else. They would then just be able to call the information by name and have it displayed.

        What if we wanted to keep the order in which the patients came in?  In the case of an emergency room or urgent care where there is no appointment times.  Do you think adding a "timestamp" key with a value to the dictionary?  If there are more than one patients then it would make sense to store the patient dictionary within a list and then we could still maintain order.
