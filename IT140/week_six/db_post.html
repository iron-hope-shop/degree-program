        Based on my experience from this activity, lists, dictionaries, and loops are useful in specific situations.  Dictionaries were useful in this activity for storing item details.  The key-value pairs in dictionaries are perfect for storing this type of information.  Lists were useful during this exercise when storing unique items.  The dictionary of item details was added to the grocery list.  I used loops to iterate through the grocery list, to print, and add item values.  Knowing when to use these contructs helps to keep the code concise, readable, and effective.
