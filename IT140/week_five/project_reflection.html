        It was important to know when to use branches in these scripts because we had a predefined set of inputs.  In these small instances of monomorphism it was hard to actually get any errors.  I leaned on experience and it seemed like my errors were all in the syntax of my output.  Codio demanded perfection.  To account for user error, I implemented error-handling pretty early on in my draft.  One error that always seems to surface is the TokenError or SyntaxError caused by missing a parenthesis somewhere.
