        At my current job we have a huge SQL database full of all sorts of information. I currently work for a Pharmaceuticals company, so you can only imagine what would be in those databases. Searching for really any type of information in these databases is relatively easy as long as you know the appropriate way to query the data

        It is great that you are already working in the industry.  I am also an engineer but at a large retailer that rhymes with MalWart.  If your team maintains that database I imagine audits are a big deal and a pain due to the sensitivity of the data.
