        Throughout my career as a software engineer I have worked with various relational database tools but I have yet to have the opportunity to work with any NoSQL solutions. As of late, the primary relational database system I use day to day is MSSQL. SQLite and H2 are the other database engines I have work with extensively both in development and production settings.

        I like how detailed your JSON is.  That is a great list of experience.  I have also worked with SQLite (using Python), H2 (using Spring Boot), and MSSQL.  NoSQL solutions are a relatively new concept to me.  My only working experience with them is via CosmosDB (Azure) which you should check out if you have not used it before.  I am not sure what the AWS or GCP equivalent are.  I agree with what what you said about the layers of abstraction in modern web applications.
