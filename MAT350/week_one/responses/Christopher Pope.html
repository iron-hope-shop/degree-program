        After struggling in my current profession to advance within the banking industry, I decided to make a switch to a growing and in demand profession in Computer Science. I have always been fascinated with computers and what makes them operate.

        I love computers!  I have sort of a hunger for more laptops but it's mostly satiated at the moment.  Glad to hear you converted to doing something you love.

        After reviewing the syllabus, I would say the Math Labs are going to be the biggest challenge. Zybooks does not provide a very detailed explanation as to what is needed in each module Math Lab.

        I'm not sure how useful it will be for your future endeavors but if you want to hone your skills with matlab, MathWorks has some tutorials on their site for free.  I just kinda walks you though the basic syntax, methods, and eventually more complex problem-solving.
