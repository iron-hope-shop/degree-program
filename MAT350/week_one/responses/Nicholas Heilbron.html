        I find inspiration in his commitment to better himself, and I wish to do his name justice when I mention him as an inspiration in the future.

        That's great.  Upskilling is definately a huge part of advancment in the tech field.  I am also a father (of 3) and feel the need for more moolah.

        Programming is a little bit more difficult for me. I am dyslexic, and I will often mess up the syntax of the program and not realize what I had done.

        Sometimes it all just becomes a jumble for me as well.  I prefer to write any scripts for class in VScode before actually submitting it.  I'm fairly certain there is also an extension for Matlab in VScode.  You might consider a <a href="https://medium.com/@chemidy/enabling-font-ligatures-on-visual-studio-code-19b71150d600">font with ligatures</a> that will show things like "->" as an arrow.  That's just my opinion, though.  I find it so much easier with the differences in resources between each class to just do it all in VScode first.
