        I have chosen a paper written about <a
            href="https://www.math.arizona.edu/~glickenstein/math443f08/bryanleise.pdf">Google's application of
            eigenvectors</a>. The author describes Google's pioneering application of eigenvectors to the early stages
        of the internet. The "importance rank" of a Google search is the result of a ranking algorithm based on
        eigenvectors.

        This paper demonstrated to me that the application of relateively basic linear alegebra to a large-scale problem
        changed the entire landscape of the internet. I wonder what the possibilities of applying concepts of this class
        to my work could have for me? A lot has changed since the early 90s; however, I believe with every new layer of
        abstraction time brings, there will be an opportunity for an elegant solution. I could potentially apply
        eigenvectors to several work-related issues I have encountered. For instance, ranking the probability that a
        user is X.

        Learning more about eigenvectors, as well as the other concepts discussed during this class, will help me
        further my career by giving me the tools to solve relevant problems in an elegant way. I will definately keep an
        eye out for opportunities to use what (little) I know about linear algebra!
