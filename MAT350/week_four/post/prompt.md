# What was the most interesting thing you learned in the modules or created for the project?
In my opinion, the project was the most interesting activity in this class so far.  It is exciting to have reached the applied linear algebra reflected in the class name.  The relevant application of knowledge to solve the networking problem was very fulfilling.

# What concepts do you feel are unclear or that you need more practice applying?
I struggled most with the concept of LU decomposition.  After applying it to the project it seems clearer; however, I still need more practice and examples of applying LU decomposition.

# What are you most excited to learn next?
I am excited to learn more concepts about linear algebra and their application to computer science.  In week one I underestimated the complexity and dedication this class takes.  Hopefully more exposure to the bigger picture will give me a better understanding of some of the concepts we have already covered.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while working on the activities or project?
Initially, I was not sure how to even begin the project based on prior knowledge.  Eventually I just applied the same concept I do to other seemingly-unsolveable problems I encounter: Google it.  After watching a few videos on network routing analysis I had a pretty good idea of how to begin.  Finally, I applied what we learned throughout the zyBooks readings, activities, and labs.
