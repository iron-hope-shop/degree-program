        The type of data I chose to write about in this post will be about a grocery list. I think utilizing a vector would be most appropriate. While linked lists are better for inserting items to the middle of a list, I feel like that isn't a necessary functionality for a grocery list with vectors having the ability to add items to the end of the list with relative ease. Another reason why to use a vector over a linked list for compiling a grocery list, smaller lists are better used with vectors rather than linked lists.

        Finally, another Brad! I agree with Jess and Jane about the adaptability of the grocery list.  I think you will need more accessible data elements with the ability to have more propeties associated with them; however, your method would probably work very quickly depending upon how the list is ordered and the layout of the store!  To your point, why complicate it if it does not need to be complicated?
