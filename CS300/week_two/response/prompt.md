# How would choosing a different data structure for the specified data affect the performance of an algorithm?

# Why is choosing a data structure important?

I would argue that if you only had a list of items without a quantity associated, the list might be useless.  Maybe a dictionary or a map would be useful for storing an item and a quantity.  If you wanted to go even further (for example, if you are the grocer instead of the shopper) you could also have child dictionaries or a json object.  For example, an item could have a property for its current stock level on the shelf, color variations, etc.

Finally, another Brad! I agree with Jess and Jane about the adaptability of the grocery list.  I think you will need more accessible data elements with the ability to have more propeties associated with them; however, your method would probably work very quickly depending upon how the list is ordered and the layout of the store!
