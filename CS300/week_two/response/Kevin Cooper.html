        For a simple list like a grocery list, I would use a vector.  The reason for using a vector in this case is the vector is essentially a one-dimensional array.  Since most grocery lists are a simple list of items, a one-dimensional array would suffice; however, the length of the list will change as your grocery shopping date approaches and grow shorter as you move through the store

        I would argue that if you only had a list of items without a quantity associated, the list might be useless.  I guess you could count the occurances of an item within the list...  Maybe a dictionary or a map would be useful for storing an item with an associated quantity?  If you wanted to go even further (for example, if you are the grocer instead of the shopper) you could also have child dictionaries or a json object.  For example, an item could have a property for its current stock level on the shelf, color variations, etc.
