    My day-to-day scenario is that of a Spotify playlist.  The data from this playlist would be best mapped to a linked list.  For example you could cycle from the current song to either the previous or next song.  The playlist will eventually restart from the beginning (if you have it on repeat) which also takes advantage of the properties of a linked list.  Additionally, the songs which are about to play can be queued up and buffered before they are played because the application knows which song is next.
