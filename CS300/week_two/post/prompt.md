Choose a type of data that you might see in day-to-day life, such as a grocery list, a contact list, employee records, or stock prices. In your initial post:

# Describe the day-to-day scenario that you chose.
My day-to-day scenario is that of a Spotify playlist.  The data from this playlist would be best mapped to a linked list.  For example you could cycle from the current song to either the previous or next song.  The playlist will eventually restart from the beginning (if you have it on repeat) which also takes advantage of the properties of a linked list.  Additionally, the songs which are about to play can be queued up and buffered before they are played because the application knows which song is next.
# Identify the type of data structure (array, vector, or linked list) that could best be used to store the data.

# Explain why. Think about the speed of the operations when determining the data structure.
