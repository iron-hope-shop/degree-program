        My biggest issue is with time management, particularly in things that don't interest me.

        Same here .  I am mostly done with classes that have absolutely no relation to my major and they were really just a grind for me.  CompSci is certainly a multi-faceted subject, though.  There are fields of CompSci I have completely zero interest in but if you are going for that completionist achievement every little bit of knowledge counts.

        P.S. I need to get that tooth brushing algorithm inscribed on the wall of the kids' bathroom.  Great stuff!
