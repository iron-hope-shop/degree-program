What did you find interesting or relatable in your peersâ€™ posts?
Based on what you wrote in your post, consider sharing a tip that you have learned for managing your time in online courses.
Do you have the same questions as your peers? If so, let your peers know so your instructor can support you and your classmates.
Compare your algorithm with that of your classmates. Is the order the same? Are the steps similar? Are there additional steps you would have included based on your own routines for these activities?
