introduce yourself to your peers, briefly state which program you are in, and discuss your career aspirations. Then, address the following:

Name one event or person that influenced you to pursue a degree in your field.
What is your comfort level with programming?
Which skills are you most confident in?
Which skills need the most improvement?
What strategies do you plan to use to manage your time and complete assignments in this course?
Reflect on the material you reviewed in Module One. What questions do you have so far?
Choose one of the following activities, or an equivalent process:
Getting to class or work
Dropping your kids off at school
Preparing a meal
Then, write out the algorithm (no more than 10 steps) that you would need to do to complete that task. For example, for dropping your kids off at school, you could start with “Wake kids up.”

Hello, my name is Brad.  I am 26, married with a wife and three children, and am currently an engineer for Information Security at Walmart.  I am in the BS for CompSci program with a focus in cybersecurity.  Although I got my first engineering job before having a degree (I still do not), these classes have really helped to reinforce the fundamentals of computer science.  Additionally, you can get pretty high in the food chain without a degree but it really takes some distinguishment.  I do my best but I think this whole experience is propelling me further than self-learning ever did.

Anyway, my father is probably the most influential person when it comes to education in my life.  He has a PhD in chemistry (boring) and really helped to set the baseline for me.  After my first attempt at college, which took place during my teens until my earlier twenties, he helped me realize I should try again and really apply myself.  Now I have a family, so-- YEAH!

I am pretty comfortable with programming, frameworks, and everything inbetween.  The skills I am confident in the most are my adaptability, aptitude, and the ability to take a zoomed-out look at a problem.  I would say that I could improve by exposing myself to new things.  I tend to apply things I learn here to my work but I try to keep in mind the phrase, "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

In terms of time management, I have allocated certain times of days in order to process the modules.  C takes me FOREVER so this is going to be GREAT!  I have no questions about the module at this time.  I am looking forward to the next one, though!

For my algorithm I have chosen the activity of "making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich." Behold:

traverse to kitchen
if strawberry jelly in refridgerator:
  grab jar, move on
else:
  settle for grape
from pantry get peanut butter
from cabinet get plate or paper towel
from drawer get butter knife
from loaf of bread get two slices
with plate or paper towel as vessel:
  place bread on vessel
spread peanut butter on one slice
spread jelly on non-buttered slice
mush slices together, buttered and jellied sides facing eachother
await kid to ask for peanut butter and jelly sandwich
go back to kitchen and start over
