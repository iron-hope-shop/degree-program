        In order to take card payments, I set up a Square account and they mailed me my first card reader that plugs into a phone or tablet. Square also comes with very helpful Point of Sale software that allows you to input your inventory, pricing, and discounts. Square allowed me to use my iPad as a POS system, and my phone as a card reader. (My phone was actually doing double duty as a hotspot so my iPad could have internet connection). Ultimately, I was able to accept all payment methods while at the craft fair.

        Your experience with utilizing Square for payment processing at the craft fair is a classic example of how technology can significantly enhance small business operations. Similar to my experience with telemedicine, your encounter with Square technology transformed a potential limitation into an opportunity. By integrating this technology, you effectively expanded your customer base and streamlined the transaction process. This scenario highlights the broader impact of technological solutions in democratizing business operations, making sophisticated tools accessible to individual entrepreneurs and small businesses. Your utilization of Square echoes a key theme in our course: technology's role in equalizing opportunities, whether in healthcare, business, or other fields.
