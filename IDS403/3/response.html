        The jump from 4G to 5G really highlights how past tech challenges, like infrastructure hurdles during the 4G era, shape our current approach to tech advancements. This historical view is super crucial in fields like computer science, helping us develop tech that's not just cutting-edge but also responsible and inclusive. It's a key lesson for all of us in the fast-paced world of technology-- learn from the past to better navigate the future.
