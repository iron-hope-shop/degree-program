Read the following and keep in mind, I want to write about early days at <a huge company>.  During that time i was in server ops, answering phone calls all day. App teams, internal users, other teams, etc. We often had to try to quantify what the impact was and escalate if major things were breaking. We had to do this ideally within X amount of time. X is the amount of time, based on the impact, to create a war room. War rooms were not fun and we had to engage all teams involved and everyone who could help. During that time, a lot of critical thinking was going on, ideas bouncing back and forth, and immediate execution of our gameplan were all important aspects of critical thinking. and make it sound way better, like a suspenseful thriller. Your target audience is academic, don't submit a word doc, submit a paper like i taught you, thesis, commentary, and the rest.

## Overview
An essential part of developing critical analysis skills is self-reflection. In this activity, you will have the opportunity to consider how using critical analysis influences your personal experience and your field of study or profession. Completing this activity will result in a draft of the first part of the reflection section of your project. It also provides an opportunity to obtain valuable feedback from your instructor that you can incorporate into your project submission.

## Directions
In this activity, you will describe how using critical analysis tools influences your personal experience and your field of study or profession.  
   
Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:

   - Consider how it has altered the way you perceive the world.
