# IDS 403 Module Six Activity Guidelines and Rubric  
## Overview  
In this activity, you will consider how the analysis of your social, cultural, or global event where a technology plays a significant role might have turned out differently if you looked at it through a different lens. You will also consider how your critical analysis can help in interactions with others. Completing this activity will result in a draft of the second part of the reflection section of your project. It also provides an opportunity to obtain valuable feedback from your instructor that you can incorporate into your project submission.

## Directions  
In this activity, you will work on the second part of the reflection section of your project. You should consider the feedback from your instructor on the previous activity. Include diverse perspectives from varied sources to support your points. Look to the SNHU Shapiro Library for assistance and consider the sources you have used thus far to support your research.  
  
You are not required to answer each question below the rubric criteria but may use them to better understand the criteria and guide your thinking.  
  
Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:  
  
1. Integrate reliable evidence from varied sources throughout your paper to support your analysis.
   1. It is important to draw from a diverse pool of perspectives from varied sources to support the analysis. This is different from the Citations and Attributions rubric criterion.
   2. Reliable evidence from varied sources should be interwoven throughout the paper itself, while citing and attributing sources will be represented as APA in-text citations and a reference list at the end of your work.
   3. You will be evaluated on both criteria.
2. Explain at least one way in which your analysis might have been different if you had used one of the other general education lenses to analyze the technology’s role in your event.
   1. This should be a brief (3–5 sentences) reflection about how using the language and perspective from a different lens would shift your view of your technology’s role in the event.
3. Explain how critically analyzing the technology’s role in your event can help interactions with those of a different viewpoint, culture, or perspective.
   1. Think about ways in which a greater awareness of technology strengthens individual conversations. Consider including an example from your life.
