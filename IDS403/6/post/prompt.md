# 6-1 Discussion: Technology and CultureContains unread posts

So far in this course, we have explored technology through the lenses of history, the humanities, and the natural and applied sciences. In this module, the social science lens is the last piece of the puzzle. Revisit the article you selected and discussed in the Natural & Applied Sciences discussion and reexamine it now through social science.  
  
Each discussion is meant to be a collaborative space for conversation in which to process the concepts within the course. To ensure an interesting and respectful discussion, you are encouraged to think creatively about your initial posts and build upon the points made by your peers. Discussing challenges that face our world often means investigating opinions and ideas different from your own. Remember to remain thoughtful and respectful towards your peers and instructor in your discussion post and replies. It is also important to review the module resources and read the prompts in their entirety before participating in the discussion.  
  
**Create one initial post and follow up with at least two response posts.**

**For your initial post, address the following:**  
1. Describe or summarize your previous the topic and technology in your previous discussion.
2. How has your understanding about the topic and technology been affected by the social science lens?
3. How does the social science lens provide different insights that improve your overall understanding about technology?
