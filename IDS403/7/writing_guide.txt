what I'm about to say will win you the respect of your friends a lifetime full of Happiness a villa and the Bahamas and maybe a really good hair day too I I don't know if it's gonna do any of those things who's to say but here's what it will do it'll definitely make you a better writer that's my promise you will be a better writer in the next 60 Minutes this week somebody asked us a question they said hey I really love your guys' writing I don't know why I have trouble with writing and uh I would love if you guys just did an episode with the the 8020 so what is the just the stuff I need to know to help me be a better writer so me and Sam sat down and we wrote down all of our secrets about how we've we've used writing to grow our careers which by by the way by the way I wouldn't even say we're necessarily great writers I would say that you and I are really good writers but what we've been great at is getting results from it would you agree yeah that's right I don't think I don't look at my stuff I'm like wow this is beautiful Pros but I do feel confident that if I needed to I can use my writing to either you know grow an audience or sell a product or convince people of something I I I feel confident in that after you know trying for 15 years and both of us have have done it right so the credibility here you know before you ever listen to any advice you should ask yourself why should I listen to this person well both me and Sam have built and sold newsletter businesses for tens of millions of dollars we've tweeted our way you know just typing little short sentences to you know a million person audience between the two of us um you know I've sold maybe $20 million worth of product online in the e-commerce world just through email um we both have taught writing courses or in some form or fashion I know I used to charge a thousand dollars a seat for my class and it was the highest rated class on Maven but here today you get the quick version for free we're charging you nothing except for there is one thing they got to do what's what do they have to do this is free right Sam it's totally free except for one thing you have to subscribe so whether you're listening on Apple on Spotify wherever you're listening or if you're already on YouTube you just got to click that button we spend all this time doing this and unlike the rest of the YouTube world where everything is completely free we're mostly free all we want in exchange is a subscribe on YouTube that's all we want we can't check if you do it we call it the gentleman's agreement it's just Honor Code amongst two legendary individuals us and you and uh we we just trust that you're going to do it all right so let's let's jump in how does somebody become a better writer how can we teach them in the next I don't know 45 minutes to become you know twice as good or three times as good as the writing I believe that that is possible if they actually do these things where do you want to start Sam so let's start with before you guys start writing and so someone asked us why write or someone asked us how do you get better at writing I actually want to change it to why you should even care about being a better writer and so there's a few bullet points that we have so the first being is this is the most self-serving thing but I want to say it up front it's persuasion in the most scalable way the reason I got into writing was I was uh selling street meat hot dogs on the side of the road and I was selling one to one and I got pretty good at it but then I realized this is really hard and so I learned about copywriting and I figured look now I can write something and it could scale to an infinite amount of people I never have to change it and I can convince people to do something now we're not just talking about copywriting we're talking about all types of writing so I can convince someone to feel a certain way whether I'm writing a short story or I'm writing a blog post I can convince someone to join my company I used copywriting on Tinder when I want to convince the girl to give me a chance and go on a date with me we're talking about all types of writing but at the end of the day we're always typically trying to persuade someone to do something so it's persuasion in the most scalable way and that's one of the reasons one of the most important self- serving reasons why I think people should care about writing what else yeah that's that's the first one the second one is is more internal and wholesome right some people are like ah I don't know if I want to do persuasion truth is you do any anything anything you're trying to make happen you're usually going to need to persuade either people to come join your company customers Partners whatever it is the second one is to write clearly you must think clearly and the reverse is true too if you want to be a great thinker you want to have Clarity of thought writing is essential tool for that so writing is a forcing function for you to be able to think clearly um you can't hide behind bad writing bad bad writing will show bad thinking uh whereas if you have great thinking and you write it'll come through and so writing is this uh it's a truth tell potion it will reveal how clear your thinking is and the the trick is most people think about it as in writing is a way for me to communicate my ideas to you and they think that oh writing is the bottleneck they're like ah I'm just not a good writer nobody ever says I'm not a great thinker but the truth is if you actually get down to it people who struggle with writing it's because they don't have the idea clear in their mind and so writing helps you clear up the fog in your brain and get Crystal Clear Clarity on what are you actually trying to say what are the ideas but it also works to not just communicate ideas but to generate them I think Paul Graham said this and it so true he goes people think that writing is only about communicating the ideas you already have but actually the truth is when you sit down to write you will generate new ideas writing is an incredible idea generator and so it's like you know starting a little fire in your brain and uh you know those Sparks can lead to new thoughts new ideas that are quite powerful and if you're not writing regularly you're missing out on some of those ideas and I think that when we say writing I'm particularly referring to longer form it could be shorter form a handful of sentences a twe whatever but often times it's longer form and the reason why I prefer that when I'm running out my ideas is you can't really hide a bad idea or you can't hide bad thinking in Long writing you know where where you can hide bad thinking in a PowerPoint now that doesn't mean that you're ideas in Long writing are going to be good but you just can't hide it you can't hide that it's bad and so that's why I prefer mapping it all out and then the third point of writing creates new ideas uh I think like you said Paul Graham said it best he has this great blog post he wrote in 2005 he said something like um 80% of your writing will be bad and then you'll have to cut cut it down to the 20% that's good and when you start writing you'll probably generate 50% more new ideas right and so it's a really great forcing function where it gives you the lanes of the road and you have to stay within those lanes and oftentimes you can change your opinion as you go and you could evolves your idea and your thinking all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM and we've all seen Jeff basos banned PowerPoint from Amazon he realized that uh PowerPoint point was this thing that sort of the most charismatic loudest voice in the room or somebody with good slide design skills could kind of like create an illusion of good thinking by using PowerPoint and actually uh he forced everybody instead to write long long form memos basically narratives and he's like in the long form written word there's no place to hide there's no way to use design or good presentation skills to uh to make it seem like this is more well thought through than it is it either is or it isn't you find out so I think it works inside of companies as well as it does out externally to your customers and potential customers so all right now let's get down to the actual tactics so that's the that's the theory now how do you actually do it so for me all the work begins before I've typed a single word and I I always say you want to begin with the end in mind what I mean by this is I before I write anything I first decide what is the reaction I want I learned this from a guy named Chris Quigley I don't know if you know Chris Quigley but he was a um just this character he came to town in San Francisco from from the UK and he was he host he had an ad agency and his Ad Agency did one specific thing they would make videos go viral and I remember talking to Chris and I was like wow it would be awesome to do a viral video that sounds like kind of like a lottery ticket thing like what if my YouTube video just went viral and got millions of views how crazy would that be and I asked him like go what's your hit rate like you know out of every hundred videos you do how many go viral one two three videos out of a hundred and he's like no if we do 10 videos eight or nine will go viral really and I was like what he's like well for two reasons and he said number one we have a large blog audience so we we can guarantee the first like 100,000 views like it will get seen it won't just get lost in the abyss of the internet of content like whatever we have it'll get seen he's like but that doesn't make it go viral that just makes sure it gets a chance it goes the second thing is we always work backwards from an emotion he goes people will only share or act if they feel something at the end so he he created this thing that he had like lol WTF OMG uh a like you know something so cute uh heartwarming and so he's like these are the only emotions that you can tap into there's like seven or eight emotions that people can can tap into and he would work backwards he would say we don't write a script until we first pick the emotion we're going for Wow or we're going for WTF outrage oh WTF outrage uh you know I'll give you example of one that I just saw yesterday Elon mus tweeted out this thing that was uh some hidden like language in a bill like a bill that's going through Senate right now that was like if the next president gets elected and they decide to stop spending on the war in Ukraine they could be up for impeachment because of the way this bill is written and and he was like oh my God the Democrats are baking this in to the bill they're trying to pass this on page 140 they're trying to slip this right under your nose without telling anybody and they're going to try to impeach Trump Trump if he got elected and tried to stop tried to you know if he got peace in the in in the in the Ukraine and stop the spending he could be up for impeachment and of course the post goes Super viral because it's outrage it's outrage from the Democrats it's outrage from the Republicans that is engineered to go viral and so similarly Chris used to have a search engine he used to be able he created a tool internally for them where they could just search by emotion and it would show them YouTube videos that are targeting that emotion and they would use it when they would brainstorm and so I stole this and I would start with I ask myself three questions what is the reaction I want that's always an emotion the next one is what is the action I want so what do I want them to do after they read this like click the buy button click the share button forward this to a friend sign my petition whatever it is who knows what it is but what's the reaction what's the action and the last thing I say is at the end of this if they could just remember one line or one takeaway one sentence what would it be what would I pick out of the whole thing that I just wrote because people remember sentences not books and so you have to think about that so I always begin with the end in mind I decide those before I ever write a word do you do something similar I do the exact same thing and typically I start with a headline and I start with the sub headline so if you share on Facebook the headlines the big text the sub headline is the 180 character thing underneath that oftentimes I go back and I rech and I change the headline a ton but that one sentence what I call the sub headline that doesn't change and that one sentence is helps like clarify what I'm going to write so I actually don't do outlines so there's a lot of things that I think you're taught in fifth grade that I think are really stupid one of them is an outline I I guess I I guess it's okay to teach that but I don't use outlines anymore and my outline instead is that one sub headline um that's what I use in fact you brought up a good point which is to be a great writer in the world like as an adult on the internet the internet world the internet world you have to unlearn pretty much everything you learned in school so in school you learned like what do they what do they reward in school they're like uh minimum of this word count so they're trying to get you you must write at least this length and they're trying to get you to like so people are writing long words and double spacing their thing and trying to like add a bunch of filler and fluff well you got to do the exact opposite when you write on the internet you want to be concise you want to be quick you want to eliminate a bunch of the fluff shorter is better on the internet in terms of adding just extra crft but when you're in school they almost Force you and teach you to write these long form things they also want you to write f with fancy fancy vocabulary so you're you get bonus points if you use you know amarate rather than you know heal or help or whatever and and so you rewarded for using fancy words but the reality is you want to be writing at a at a very like accessible language if you want uh reading level if you want to do well on the internet so you know both you and I we target kind of like fifth to eighth grade reading levels and you can use these tools these Checkers like Hemingway is an app that you could use where you could put in your text and it'll tell you you're writing at a 12th grade level or you're writing at a fifth grade level and the lower the better is better on the internet yeah and in the in the second half of this episode let's go through all those like tips and tricks um in terms of in terms of writing my process is I I do copy work and then I draft then I incubate and then I edit so what that means is copy work it's the same way it's this old technique that people have learned how to write um we don't do it anymore but I found it to be the most effective way I I sat myself a room for like two hours a day and did this for like eight months in order to learn how to write and copy work is basically when you take write writing that you love it could be a full book it could be a script for SNL if you want to learn how to write comedy it could be a blogger that you like when I'm writing an important piece I'll just write maybe for 10 minutes I literally take my pen and by hand I copy someone else's writing that I really like and that helps me get into the flow so we what we said was before you've written a word you like most people just sit down they start trying to write what we've told you is do two two different things instead begin with the end in mind you know the what is the action the reaction you want and what's the what would be the headline that would grab somebody and then the second thing Sam's saying is you don't just jump in like a you know if you're GNA go do a workout you don't just go start sprinting right away you warm up I do warm-up sets and you do the same thing before you write a word of your own you start by writing but not your own words you take some writing that you really like that maybe you want to almost like through osmosis just steal their little writing Juju it's going to go into your brain you'll start to talk like them write like them if you do this and you literally write word for word exactly what they said it's even more effective if you handw write it but at worst type it but you want to don't don't think don't add your own stuff don't improve it just literally write word for word and do it for like even 10 15 minutes I still do this today this is not like advice that I tell other people to do I don't do I still do this today and Sam you don't know this I use one of your posts as one of my I have like three go one of yours is one that I use for my copy work it's this one where you I forgot the name of the blog but it's I always search for it with the same headline which is uh let me be perfectly clear you're reading this because I want because I want you to um and you're like I have engineered the start of this to and you basically talk about how you've mesmerized them you're like every word of this was chosen every sentence to lead you to the next sentence and I love that it's we call it the slippery slope and so you uh I use one of yours whenever I want to write like in a really persuasive copyrighted way if I want to write more like business serious then I have a different one I use this one that the CEO of slack did where he wrote an internal memo that I really like called we don't s Saddles here but you literally just write it word forward so that's your warmup so again two things before you ever write your own stuff it's exactly like playing music okay so if you're whether when you're a beginner playing music you just play other people's songs and then you steal a little bit you're like oh I like I like this genre this genre this genre I'm G to combine it to my own thing same way where you're writing a new song you kind of warm up maybe playing The Beatles and then eventually you're like all right I'm in the mood to write something beautiful this is what I'm going to do you take someone's recipe and you make their recipe before you go make your own thing you play a cover before you write your own songs same way you do copy work before you write your own stuff the second step is actually where a lot of people get screwed up so it's the drafting step and the reason people get screwed up here is because they're afraid to look stupid and the drafting step is actually where you're supposed to look stupid and so whenever I draft something I just bang it out as fast as I can and it sounds really dumb and I accept that it sounds dumb and I and here's why because after the draft set is the incubation period you know like um have you ever heard of like the phrase like shower thoughts where you like think of silly things in the shower I actually I think there's like some science behind this I think I forget what it's called but it's like when you're out riding a bike when you're out going for a walk where you're just sitting things I think it's called passive thinking you actually get great breakthroughs and so what I like to do is I draft my first thing they doesn't take very long and I know that it's bad but I don't show anyone then I go for a walk or I'll just sit sometimes that will take 4 48 Hours sometimes that will take one hour sometimes 10 minutes sometimes a week I just let it sit and then I do nothing now here's where the the last part and the most important part is uh Olie one of my favorite writers what's his first name David David Ogie he's got this great line he goes I'm a lousy writer but I'm a good editor and this is where greatness happens happens Stephen King calls it killing Your Darlings he says when the editing phase where all the great stuff happens and this is actually where the gold happens and a lot of people don't do this process what they do is they write their dress and that's the final bit and they get afraid and nervous and they never write it and they don't actually incubate and they don't actually edit do you do these things 100% you I learned this from you uh the incubate part so I used to draft and then try to edit in the same session because I knew editing is where the value is right great writing is great editing let's be perfectly clear great writing is great editing however the mistake I was making before was I would write and then I would immediately try to edit and power through and I didn't have that break that Gap to actually go I can improve my ideas passively just load the problem in my brain and go do something else go for a walk go for a run go for a workout go shower go cook some food chop some vegetables doesn't matter what it is but I give myself actually like at least 90 minutes away from it sometimes six hours away from it and then when I come back I look at it and it's just so obvious to me oh strike this delete this move this to the top that's actually the best part oh you know what I should say here I should say this oh that analogy I was missing here it is and so you immedi it starts to come together when I do that that part right and I also realize I need to shift my time ratio because like you like you said I used to be a overthinker drafter where I would overthink how much I need to how much time to spend in the draft phase so I try to make a good draft bad idea you actually just want to have a like like quick and dirty draft like a brain dump draft and so I used to try to make a good draft that would take me way too long and I get fatigued and i' feel bad about it and I'd be like I hate this this is stupid should I even do this and all the doubts creep in and then I'll try to edit right away now short draft and then high energy edit after I have that incubation period so this is um 100% what I do and it is extremely effective and once you get good and once you find a process sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night and I think of an idea and I just write that sentence in my phone and then I just forget about it but then I see something else in the world and I'm like oh that reminds me of this concept I was I was thinking about he wake up figured it out yeah I figured out the CTA is it weird if I sign off with cyanara suckers yeah wait what do you think about I love you at the end would that be a thing but I I actually do like well I'll have like a a do you have like a Notes app or a notes folder in your phone where it's like you just have like a sentence and you're like that's a beautiful sentence I'm just I don't I don't know where I'm going to use that but that was a beautiful sentence or a lot of times I get it from podcasters or you YouTubers I'm like you you hear how he phrased that that word that was a sharp phrase that cut to me one of the things we didn't say in the before phase is having a swipe file so yes classic thing that all writers have and all marketers have which is a swipe file it's basically a stash whenever you see something dope something that's well done something that's good you just stash it away so that when it comes time for you to make one you could be like I need to make a landing page and you would go and you'd look at your stash of great landing pages you've seen and you would have so much inspiration right there ready for you at your fingertips because you did the work before befor hand and so that's another one of the before is you got to have a swipe file we I have one for phrases for headlines for connecting words for sign for hellos and goodbyes because for some reason whenever IID write my newsletter I knew what I wanted to say but the start always was so awkward it was like a hello you know hello there friends and I was like God this sucks and then I started keeping a a file of like anytime I liked an lik an opener or a closer so I have one opener's file one closer file and I have a whole bunch in there that I can use to riff off of because that for whatever reason that was my my blocker when I would write I I'll just hear a beautiful phrase and I'll write it down so like I went to this guy's website and uh he was talking about the best like speaker system or something and he started off the paragraph with well folks it doesn't get any better than this and I was like oh in beautiful that's mine yes and like I I just have this whole Bank of like these things of people saying like cute phrases I'm like oh that's a be like I just felt an emotion when I read that basically you have to think every people are scrolling through thousands of Articles every day and I if I see a line that grabs my attention I know that's good that's mine that's mine and I just have this whole Bank of these so let's move on to um some more tips about talking about the actual writing part because I think that what you're taught in school we're basically going to say do the opposite of a lot yeah here's right here's the mistakes common mistakes mistake number one they start with a bunch of intro context background fluff uh you wrote a the tip is actually don't bury the lead so the first sentence should punch so try putting the most important sentence at the top try putting the most provocative statement at the top try putting the promise at the top or the the bait the hook at the top so as an example you have one here that when when you were building the hustle one of the things you tried to do was these viral blog posts you were like I'm gonna write these blog posts if I can get a million views on those blog posts and you know some percentage of them will subscribe that's how I'll grow my subscriber base right and I remember reading this which was first sentence I spent the last 30 days eating nothing but soilent a new age powered powdered meal replacement why would I do something so stupid I'll explain but first if you're not familiar with soent here's the gist a great opener right because rather than saying you know um you know the last few days have been uh you know really tough for me because I've been doing this new experiment to give you background who I am I'm Steve I'm a programmer here at this company and you know I'm blah blah blah boring right so instead I spent the last 30 days eating nothing with soilent why would I do something so stupid let me explain Curiosity has been created and now I want to know yeah typically when you're thinking about the lead so I found it helps with a few things one if you're new what I tell people is let me see your opener cut it in like cut almost all of it except for like the last couple sentences and that's typically a good trick and the reason why I say that is when you're taught in school how to write have you ever heard of like a a thesis statement where you have like a opening paragraph with the thesis at the bottom 0.1 point two three and then a closer I'm like just tell me your thesis statement right off the right off like just just say that just punch me in the face with that that should be your that should be your opening line another thing is I like to think of um have you ever been to England and have you ever noticed they have signs that say mind the gap right I guess that's like when you're I always say mind the Curiosity Gap so mind so with the Curiosity Gap means I'm gonna I'm gonna punch you in the face to grab your attention because that gets you to fall down the slippery slope and the more that you fall down that slope the further you're going to continue to read and so I I want to grab your attention but I don't want to tell you exactly everything but I want to grab your attention by not bearing the lead and I'm going to get you to fall down this slope a little further yeah that's simple test is take your hand cover up all of the text except for the first two sentences read those first two sentences and be like would if I didn't know me if I didn't care about me if I didn't if I didn't have to read this would I want to read would I need to read the next sentence not would I need to read the whole thing but I need to read the next sentence if it's yes you've created a curiosity app then you drag your hand down you reveal that next sentence you say if I read this sentence would I need to read the next sentence right would I want to know what what's the next sentence and then by the third or fourth time you've done that now they're in now they're invested now you have a little more leeway to let it breathe and and and cre and create a little bit of background because they're they're have they're invested in getting to the end of the of the outcome but like the reason this sounds so brutal where you're going to cover up I like I'm G to cover up 85 90% of the text yes because the reality is that's actually how the reader eyes work 80 90% of people are only ever going to read the headline and if the headline is no good they're never going to get to any of the other stuff and so some people are resistant to write a juicy headline but the reality is if it's not juicy enough they'll never get to that those great ideas that you have inside you're sort of doing your own ideas of disservice and so you want to find that line between like without completely whing yourself out or making a false promise still find a way to make it juicy enough where you created that Curiosity Gap where I have to read the next sentence and that's it what I what I used to say was it ain't clickbait if if you're actually getting something like it bait means it's fake so as long as I can say the truth but I say it is sens Sensational or clicky way we us to say clicky it ain't bait if I actually deliver on the promise you have to pay it off if you don't pay it off then then it's bad but if you're paying it off and you're paying it off soon you can't pay it off like you know 10 minutes later you have to you have to be able to do that all right next one is write like you talk so so many times people are like I can't really like I'm not good at I'm not a good writer and again I'm not a good writer is actually code for I'm not a good thinker and the way you test this is cool forget about writing it down just tell me like explain it to me either they just say it out loud and I'm like great you wrote it just write that down now like write down literally what you just said you don't have to have like this second character this Shakespeare inside you that writes in a completely different style and communicates completely differently than you actually talk you don't need that you actually want them to be very similar it's actually the most engaging type of writing is when you feel like the author's just talking to having a conversation with you specifically and so right like you talk is a good good method but it also reveals if you can't even talk about it you're not ready to write it yet you got to First be able to like explain it just in plain language yourself what I tell my team so they'll like write this huge thing and ask me to read it and I'm like I don't really want to read this just tell me what it means and they'll say in one sentence I go okay cool that's your first sentence um and that's probably all you need to say for this thing uh but like there's a few ways to figure out what not to do one is you go to people's uh LinkedIn if they use the word utilize that's probably not good have you ever heard someone say they utilized or they did like what are other like LinkedIn jargon LinkedIn like that's that's so good we should make a LinkedIn hit list of just uh words that nobody ever says but people think it's okay to write yeah it's like dude I've never heard you you use that word utilize right the the second thing to remember is there's informal is or rather informal can be professional a lot of times people think informal is the opposite of professional and I actually say that's that's nonsense and I'm going to actually show examples of how that's not true in a few minutes but and another good line that I think about is uh it was Stephen King he says any word you have to hunt in a thesaurus is the wrong word there's no exceptions to this rule uh and so like if you have to like look up like what a word means you don't use it you want to use words that most everyone uses and I'm again I'm going to show you examples of really complicated stuff explained in a really simple way like here's a really good example of writing like you talk so one of my favorite pieces of writing is Louis CK so Louis CK about 10 or 15 years ago he used to release his own specials like on his website and if you Google Louis CK Neville madora or something like that you'll see my friend Neville wrote a blog post about some of his stuff because it's it's actually not up anymore but he's got this great uh line in one of his bits he says or one of his landing pages he goes

a shitload of money to make these specials and I do it myself I love off offering directly for so cheap and so easily and I would like for that to continue being a good idea that's a great simple way just to say don't steal uh and and and that makes me feel I'm like all right you're right this is I should abide by this you are exactly right there is no jargon simple language yeah 100% agree I also think that uh you know this also works for choosing what to write about so for example sometimes people will write about that they would never talk to you about we had this problem early on at the milk road so when we did the milk Road I was the initial writer so I created the initial voice and milroad was a a newsletter that we built in the crypto space and we went from zero subscribers and never have written a daily newsletter before to the biggest crypto newsletter in the world and sold it for millions of dollars that in one year so that was the the success outcome so how did we actually do it and more importantly how did I train other people to write it instead of me because I didn't want to wake up every morning and stress about sending this email out at 500 a.m. to you know a couple hundred thousand people that that was not the idea of a good life for me so I was like me see if I can train people to do this one of the hacks to training people to do this was I I was like God I feel like they're writing this both with too much extra fluff and jargon and secondly they're writing about stuff that's kind of boring so like the topic is boring I'm like what's happening I was like and I told him I was like I feel like you would never just tell me about this like if I was just talking to you if I was your your friend and you were like oh did you hear what happened today which is what a news what a new what the news is trying to tell you right hey did you hear what happened today this crazy thing happened this interesting thing happened this big event happened I was like you're writing about stuff that wouldn't even make that filter you wouldn't even tell me about it so why are you doing this so what I had them do I was like forget writing a draft and having me be the editor instead I want you to send me a voice memo no more than 60 seconds in the morning which is basically oh do you hear what happened today uh this guy said this thing and people are freaking out because of blah blah blah and this announcement was made and people think it's going to be a big deal and the price is going to go up because that would mean this and as soon as they started doing that I was like yep that sounds perfect just write that down and it just was such a good filter and so one way to think about what to write about and how to write it is do this little kind of voice memo test so can you just if you were just to tell your friend about this you know hey I have this idea blah blah blah or you know I noticed this thing I found it really interesting because blah blah blah blah and if you can't if it's not interesting to your friend guess what it's not gonna be interesting to a stranger right like you have to be able to to explain it in a way that's simple and use that as a filter if you would never talk about it don't write about it well and the the tip that I used to give so when I sold the hustle we had close to 2 million subscribers I believe and for new writers they would they like would kick ass in their audition and then they would get nervous like when they're I'm like yeah two million is a lot of people I get it but here's the tip write to me write to Sam just literally you are only writing to me and that's what I tell people when they're writing blog posts when they're writing anything else just write to one person you're only writing to one human being it's just coincidence that many others might read it but just only write to one one person Direct to that one person and that's the way to go uh and so it makes it a lot easier right uh let's go to let's go to uh WR simply what I found is around you can go as low as fourth grade but around sixth seventh and eighth grade reading level is the way that you want to write now to give you guys perspective I think USA news.com USA news the newspaper I believe that's at a fourth grade reading level New York Times which is highly regarded by a lot of people that's at a seventh grade reading level and I actually went and put Warren Buffett Warren Buffett writes about insurance companies a very complicated topic I went and put his stuff through Hemingway app as well same thing sixth seventh eighth grade reading level and it teaches you how to write at that level and there's tactics on how to do that like don't use adverbs keep sentences short but Heming Way app is an awesome way to um check yeah to check to do it for you yeah I think that's a great one um another one that you wrote in here is about storytelling and so I think storytelling is now like kind of in the more advanced uh a little more advanced category of how to be a great writer is being able to use use the artst storytelling uh do you want to give an example of that uh or how do you want to talk about storytelling here so here's an example of Storytelling so about 10 years ago there was this company called hint hint water it's you see it's like a beverage that you guys see in the stores it's called um and the the lady named Cara she had this great story she went and gave this talk uh at one of my events and there was at the very end there was one question that someone asked her and I heard that story and of the 60-minute talk I was like oh that's a that's a hit because that just made me feel something so the headline was getting called sweee help this entrepreneur create a multi-million dollar business sweetie the executive said and I just dropped the phone for a minute last week at pizza and 4S Cara golden the founder of hint told me a story that fired me up the setup goes like this and it explains a story about how she was drinking 10 Cokes a day she was on the phone with an executive of Co Coca-Cola and she said I'm going to create a new version of water that just has a a little bit of fruit in it and no sugar an executive at Coke goes listen sweetie americaas love sweet this is never going to work by the way that's a great example of working backwards from an emotion even if you didn't consciously do it in this case you you knew that story would hit because it has outrage it has a WTF OMG type of reaction of like but let me fill you in on the results so I wrote the blog post not in order to promote hint I wrote the blog post because I thought this was just a cool story of a this entrepreneur getting like it was a sexist moment and she was getting hated on whatever hint saw the article they ended up spending millions of dollars to promote this article and at the very bottom of the article and it it says something like this conversation inspired golden now 17 laters 17 years later to found hint and they do 100 million in sales uh here's the flavors they have this article made them tens of millions of dollars in sales we used to get so much traffic to this article because they ended up promoting it I wasn't selling hint water I was just telling a cool story about the founder and in exchange it made all these people want to buy this stuff and if in fact if you Google hint waterer sweetie article you'll see articles written about this article about how it was a huge success and this was sort of an accident I just wrote something cool and they actually were like oh let's promote this but it worked wonderfully because it was a story that grabbed your attention you want to say a few words on on how to how to write a great story I have a couple of tips you do it so a couple of tips on on writing a great story or tell telling a great story so go look at the greatest storytellers ever uh one of them is uh Aaron sorin he's known for writing great dialogue he wrote you know the The Social Network movie he wrote uh what is it westwing he wrote The Newsroom he great writer famous right famous Hollywood writer he says I worship at the altar of intention and obstacle so what he says is a story is just two things somebody has an intention some somebody wants something and there's obstacle in their way by the way that line I worship at blank altar at the altar of blank yeah so that that is going into my bank to your bank H that's F all right so uh so intention and obstacle intention is some character wants something and then there's an obstacle in their way the more they want it like their daughter was just taken hostage huge huge intention obstacle They Don't Know by who where they are and all they have to go on is this one 5-second call that they were on or whatever right like obstacle they they have no way to find them and they're just a Dad how are they going to ever you know get their daughter back and so intention and obstacle is the core element of any good story so somebody wants something in in the case that you just said not only does Cara want to make her business successful she wants to be taken seriously as a female entrepreneur obstacle Coke executive men men are pigs nobody believes in her right that's a core that's a core of a story and so any story if you can't they say like in a movie you should be able to pause at any moment of any story and say what does that character want and what's in their way and if you can't pause and name that right now you have failed as a Storyteller because the audience you you think they're you're going to tell them later what the they want no no you've lost their attention the the initial stakes and if you watch any movie they establish this right and even like silly romcoms it'll be uh she wakes up she's got her assistant and chauffeur driving her to work she's clearly high powerered but her but she's alone and she's doesn't have a relationship right like that'll be it'll be obvious to her she'll see somebody out the window while she's driving to work in her chafford limousine and it's this girl in love with her boyfriend and she looks at it kind of longingly and then she just goes back to her her you know Palm Pilot or whatever before back to work and so you know what the character wants and you know what's in her way she's she doesn't have somebody because she hasn't find the route guy and she's so busy with work and so everything is always this intentional obstacle the second thing is you have to establish like how do you make a story Better or Worse Stakes is the next thing so what is at stake uh what do you have to lose if this doesn't go well and Stakes doesn't have like Stakes initially the beginner version of stakes is life or death but the true art and some if you like some of the stories that I've told on this podcast the true art is when you can establish high stakes emotions in a low stakes environment so if I can tell you how I was feeling and if I can get you to believe that I thought everything was on the line just with some little interaction I was having with the like this person in the grocery store line and how I didn't want them to win cuz them and they can't cut they cut in front of me but I'm not going to I'm not going to cut in front of them but I need them to know that it wasn't okay but I don't know how to do it without being an myself and if I can establish the stakes that this matters to me I can get you to care about the outcome of it but it can be in a low Stak situation now you're really cooking with gas if you can do something like that because otherwise you're limited to just life or death stories the best example you have done of that you're very good at this is um I I distinctly remember this story of you do you doing a shirtless workout on your driveway and your HOA being like no we we can't have this and you're like we're going to Petty Court we're going to Ho like I just that was a I let this go or I could fight to the death as a matter of principle here because you know what are you trying to say and what does this mean right and if it means something to me that I can make it mean something to you so that sort of thing so Larry David's great at this too like when never I watched that show Kirby Your Enthusiasm like they're making a story out of something so silly and small uh you know it's it's 10 times more likable when it's something relatable or small but it still carries the emotional impact and if you could do that you have infinite supply of stories he notices that people don't talk people don't talk to someone if they're wearing a Maga hat and so he starts wearing a Maga hat all the time he's like I don't want anyone to talk to me I'm just gonna wear this hat yeah uh that that's a really good example of a high stakes uh high stakes and a low stakes environment where like it doesn't really matter but it's very funny um and then let's talk about uh tactical stuff so short sentences um I'm a firm believer in short sentences and so the I'll give you I'll explain why but Warren Buffett owns you know runs birkshire halfway birkshire owns dozens and dozens of companies arguably the most complicated one is Geico insurance companies are very very very hard to understand however I don't remember if the hustle did analysis on this or someone else did but he writes these famous annual shareholder letters every single year he he's a very good writer and listen to this from uh 1974 to 2013 someone analyzed this and the letters per or sorry the words per sentence dropped from 17 to 13 if you look at like we actually did an analysis on this every year it gets shorter and shorter and shorter and the reading level dropped from a 10th grade to a fourth grade reading level so the Richer he got and the more complicated his businesses got the simpler the writing got because he just got better at explaining it a really easy to understand way and he's probably once kind of somewhat the average show to be able to understand this and so short simple sentences are key even in complicated environments and here's a really good example so if you go to hey.com so hey.com is an alternative to Gmail it's a it's a service that makes you pay though so it's even they they've raised the stakes there so you have to pay for their email there's a letter from the CEO and that's one of my favorite uh like tactics by the way in a sales page is letter from a CEO and he says hey everyone I'm Jason CEO of 37 signals email gets a bad rap but it shouldn't email is a treasure and he goes on to explain why uh email is awesome and why it should be more special than it is and it's the most simple language to explain email and I love it and there's lots of examples of simple language and and simple ways to explain complicated things and if you're able to do that often times they will have shorter sentences less words and it it's significantly more in uh effective than longer stuff related to that it doesn't have to be only one length so there's this great graphic that's gone viral many times you probably seen it great writing has Rhythm so there's a an example so I'll just read this out loud he goes this sentence has five words here are five more words five word sentences are fine but several together become monotonous listen to what is happening this writing is getting boring the sound of it drones it's like a stuck record the ear demands some variety now listen I vary the sentence length and I create music music the writing sings it has a pleasant Rhythm a lilt a Harmony I use short sentences and I use sentences of medium length and sometimes when I'm certain that the reader is rested I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length a sentence that burns with energy and builds with the impetus of a crescendo the role of the drums the crash of the symbols and sounds that say listen to this this is important so write with a combination of short medium and long sentences create sound that pleases the reader ears don't just write words write music that I love that it is amazing and so you want to have short by default but then like he says when the reader is rested and ready use a long sentence to great effect and so that's like an advanced move when it comes to writing most people's problem is every every sentence is too long and so you start with short sentences but then you figure out how to vary it so that you're writing sings whenever I uh sometimes when I write something that I get really into I I almost feel like uh I'm like I Channel like my inner Eminem or like some rapper or something where I'm like what type of Rhythm could get people flowing like I need to have a Rhythm that gets people to fall down this and like there's small tactics like anytime you want to use a comma use a period and then start the next sentence with and or but um or there's other things like put your internal dialogue like um or like or or the reader's internal dialogue like so why would I do this you're asking yourself right now right or who the hell is this person talking to me through my computer screen telling me what to do and why on Earth should I trust them like you can do these little things to change the Rhythm grab people's attention yeah 100% uh that's a that's a great way of putting it I also think like the Rhythm thing is uh it comes from the copy work so back to the copy work at the beginning if you do copy work on something that has Rhythm like I will write that that same thing that I just read out loud I'll write that in my copy work takes whatever 55 seconds but now I'm already kind of revved up to write in that style to have that that variety that Rhythm when I write the next thing should we wrap up by saying some resources that we both Ed in order to get influenced yeah yeah how do you learn how do you get better from here because this was the crash course just hit on a bunch of bunch of the big topics there's obviously a lot of nuance and subtlety and like doing it takes both practice as well as like a little bit of deeper understanding but where where should people go so what I'll start with some some books that I like I like onw writing by Stephen King that changed my life um I like that one a lot um what do you like about that by the way I read that book I didn't love it what what was so good about it I just felt that he was teaching me how to write better and but he was living it as he was going and so the first half of the book I believe is his biography and the second half is tool he calls it the the toolkit where he explains like how he does stuff and I just felt in the biography part he was doing it and then the in the toolit part te me yeah and so I really appreciate that but then I also get a lot of inspiration from funny original thinkers you know who one of the most original like people with words right now is theovon so I'll hear theovon like for example he had an ad for athletic greens and he goes today's sponsors athletic greens I know what you thinking what is this just a bunch of aliens playing track and field and like like he he does these like silly things and unexpected silly things and he's like a treasure Trove of like interesting phrases so I'm a big fan of like listening to what he's saying and why I also listen to a ton of comedians because they've perfected this so like Dave Chappelle is really great with timing Shane Gillis really good with timing and so I pay attention to lot of those guys on how they get people's attention so I like onw writing I like Theo van um I listen to a lot of True Crime podcasts and True Crime podcasts because they're supposed to be thrilling they are excellent at storytelling and setting up tension and so I love uh there's this company called parcast they've got serial killers unsolved murders and I really love how they set up tension what do you like I like a lot of those same things you said I I also like to consume them in a different way so I think everybody likes Dave Chappelle or Lis c k but you know when I wanted to get good at this I started to study what they do not just laugh and move on right so I would there's there's an amazing amazing thing what I think is the I have two two things I've learned from comedians I think are the best examples of both storytelling to win people on your side and of apologizing so the apologizing one is after Louis CK got cancelled he basically disappeared for like a year and a half and he came back and he did his first show on stage and there's a big question in my my head it's like how is he going to address this what's he say you people should go listen to it in in full but basically first he doesn't address he's he's doing his normal act and he pauses just in the middle of like doing a thing and he's just like so should we talk about it all right we could talk about it and he just brings it up like in the he makes it awkward because like what he did was like weird and pretty gross and bad whatever so what he did was instead of backpedaling and apologizing instead of denying instead of trying to spin it as good he was was like everybody's got a thing some people's things are weirder than others but everybody's got a thing that they like Barack Obama knows my thing B he makes fun of himself like it's basically poke like my thing is so weird that I liked and did and everybody knows about it and he kind of wins you on his side like just the ComEd the idea of even Obama knows my thing like everybody's got a thing but it's secret usually and so then he goes and and there's more to it but he does that Chappelle does one when when they took the Chappelle show they put it on Netflix and he wasn't getting any royalties from it he's like man they're using my name they're putting my show up there I have a fight with these guys and my fans are watching it and Netflix is winning and the studios everyone's winning except for Chappelle from the Chappelle show right so he goes on stage he does this 20 minute thing called I think it's called unforgivable or Unforgiven or something like that I'm going to do a full YouTube breakdown of this because it is to me it is like the Master Class class in how do you tell a story to win people on your side it is so well done I I I can't even do it J I'm going to do a full breakdown of like what I think he did that was so smart and I have studied this thing and I've been like I can't believe like I would have never come up with this as a way to to make that point to get people at the end to be totally on his side and willing to like boycott the show how did he get people to do that and the way he told the story where he's not giving you a lecture he's not just coming out and saying it outright he kind of baked it in at the end uh but he set the setup was so strong that you there's only one outcome you could have it's a maze that led you to one door which is I'm on Dave's side I'm gonna do exactly what this guy just said and to me when I saw that I was like that was the best example I've ever seen of using storytelling for Mass persuasion I uh I I want to go watch that another person I love have you ever read Joel on software Joel on software.com yeah you're going from Chappelle to to Joel the vaker of Trello nice dude I know that that like sounds ridiculous but he's this like nerdy guy who has started I think stack Overflow and Trello all these like companies dude his blogs are very funny on the dorkiest topics like I don't even understand a lot of the topics because it's like heavy engineering he does such a good job of writing on on these topics I love what I one of my favorite things to do is find the top post on Hacker News because typically these engineering types of people are particularly quirky and they kind of think outside the box yesterday I don't know if you saw it yesterday there's a great one a great example of this some guy wrote the Kroger app sucks or something like that and it was like the number 15 thing on Hacker News I click it and it's this like 10,000w blog post about Kroger's technology and he's just like he's like I like Kroger Kroger's the biggest Grocer in the world and he's like they should be good at technology they have all the money and they have the customers they have all the locations like they should not be getting their their you know they ass handed to them by instacart and these other like startups he's like look at this you open the Kroger app and it doesn't like you swipe and it doesn't he's like the whole internet is if you swipe it'll load more stuff for Kroger if you want to swipe to see more products it stops you and there's this tiny button that says like next page you have to go page after page it doesn't just load he's like that's terrible and he's like here's this other thing and he wrote this like 10,000w thing like nerding out about the Kroger app and I loved it I read every word of it I was like this is this is incredible nury right here I love this thing he's got a great opening line he says I'll start by saying I know nothing about the grocery industry but what I do know about is Tech and ux uh and so that's a great way to like kind of get people down your slippery slope but this is a really good article and I love it's not even that this is particularly good writing but what I would say is that this is effective writing because the best writing the biggest lesson of it all is that you want your content to just be you pushed out I think everybody thinks they have to like become some character in order for their content to hit to work to be to be a m to be a popular or whatever and you could kind of do that and you might even get some popularity but it'll never work in the long run because it's not you being you and uh those people are attracted to something that's not your actual brain your actual thoughts you got to let that freak flag fly baby you got Let it Fly flag fly and you know that's how this podcast worked is like I started with this interview format trying to emulate it's almost like copy work I was like emulating the Tim Ferris show or how I built this or whatever but then when it was just his me pushed out it's like I'm going to get on here we're going to talk some days about writing and some days about mindset some days about this Niche business that's uh you know tire rims in in North Carolina that's crushing it it's like that's the I'm into so that's the I talk about that's the thing I'm most passionate about that's the thing I can have I have the most interesting things to say about and because of that it's just me pushed out and then it's going to attract people who really like that and nobody can compete with me at that thing right like that that is a a personal Monopoly there is nobody else who could do what I'm doing as well as I'm doing you could do the same thing with your writing so just take the stuff you're most interested in or nerd out about the most and post that even if it seems like does anyone else really care about this you'll find the people that care about it if you just consistently do that which is what this episode is we're talking about a topic that you and I actually care a ton about and I guess we're going to find out if the rest care about it but it will find those who do next time for the next what what are we call this questionable advice next time are we doing business plans I think yeah we're doing a one on the next questionable advice which is we kind of laugh at like oh you don't need to write a business plan that's archaic but like we do do some ver version of planning before we just start a business so we're going to share what do we actually do in our planning before we start a business that we found is effective for us so that'll be the next one should we and we each got to plug our thing although I think your thing is no longer a thing uh yeah but I'm inspired by doing this I'm like I want to tell people about this and actually like because I have I have a course that does this but I have a ton of examples and the examples are actually what's valuable because you might hear some of the things we talked about you're like okay I got to look that up I got to look that up look that up but in the course I basically put it all there where I'm like here's the principle here's the example you actually it's principle you try it then it's here's the example of it done well another example of it done well another example of done well try it again and literally if you just do that you'll get better as a writer that's like a a structured form of practice so my course is not so much me talking about it it was that and I'm like if somebody actually wanted to learn that you kind of need that you kind of need to have those gold star examples and you need to have like a place to go practice like try it learn it then try it again so I just Googled sha Perry power writing it takes me to Maven and you can join the weight list is that where people should go yeah but I'm gonna boot it back up so I have this weight list it's got I don't know it's got a lot of people on I think but I should I haven't done it in like a year and a half I kind of like retired from it but this episode made me fired up about it so maybe that'll fade in in an hour I'll be like no that I'm not doing it but uh if not I'll I'll do one more one more of these this year and then then I have a thing only on copywork I love copy workor it changed my life I got this thing I made it like in a weekend two years ago just for shits and giggles because I it just I like it it's fun for me it's called copy that.com and it's my best versions of what I think people should write and copy and then you copy it by hand and I break down why each point is interesting so you can check it out copy that it's got a ton of good reviews you could actually I actually try to post all the negative reviews and the positive reviews so you can see all the reviews it's copy that.com so Google Shan Pur power writing and you'll see his page on maven.com and then copy that.com we'll put them both in the description so it'll be at the top of the description here we'll put the links to the to the things we talked about in this episode because I think if you're listening to this you're driving or you're walking it's very hard and we're usually not that good with show notes but today Ari let's try to be good with the show notes where all the resources we talked about let's make it easy um and put it put it there for people so that they can just scroll down and get it dude there's 8,000 people on the white list for the course I didn't even I haven't looked at this in so long this was like 500 last time I looked that's crazy you should do that right that's actually too many I don't think I can do so many people at once because I'm pretty like I'm live with them and I'm like doing student feedback so that would be I don't think that's even doable I I couldn't possibly do even I've never the biggest one we ever did was like 400 so 8,000 people is just not gonna work you'll figure it out um is that the pod that's the pod
