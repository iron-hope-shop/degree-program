        In this course, my understanding of tech's role in society has changed. I viewed technology as a tool. It
        enhances efficiency. Yet, I've explored the four lenses: social science, natural science, humanities, and
        history. Through this, I've come to see technology's complex impact on people and society. These lenses have
        shown tech as a catalyst for change. It is also a medium for creativity. It is a subject of science. And, it is
        a key factor in our history. Looking to the future, technology's effects seem promising and daunting. It has
        potential for positive advances and tough ethical dilemmas. I plan to use my newfound insights in my work going
        forward. You should, too. We advocate for responsible technology use. We promote digital literacy. We also study
        the impacts of new technologies. We do this to ensure that all can access and enjoy new technology. The most
        impactful thing we can do is share the ideas we have learned.
