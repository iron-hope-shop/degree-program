        Our journey through technology's landscape shows a world. It is full of complexity and contrast. Your deep dive into the stories of the nuclear bomb and the war shows how different cultural lenses affect history and perception. I wrote about digital literacy and ethical use and you highlight the need for informed opinions. You are practicing digital literacy and our opinions tie together well. I am glad to hear your perspective changed and that this class was a positive experience. I feel the same way, I learned a lot.
