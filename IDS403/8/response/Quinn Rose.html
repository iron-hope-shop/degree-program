        Since I am graphic designer, AI technology being able to create graphics threatens my field of work by replacing me. But understanding the technology will allow us designers to adjust how we work to stay relevant; AI may be able to make things, but it wonâ€™t be able to generate creative ideas. Moving forward I will have I understand how to utilize AI technology in my work to my advantage.

        Like you, my perspective on technology's role has evolved. We both appreciate the multi-lens approach. But, your focus on AI in graphic design highlights a unique challenge and opportunity. Your perspective shows how AI is not a threat. It is a tool that can enrich graphic design. It pushes us toward more creative and meaningful work. Your insight into using AI creatively complements my post for responsible tech advocacy. I will submit that it will make art and inspiration more accessible for all. That is definitely a positive because I can only draw stick figures.
