This case made the news because sensitive user data was compromised.  THe target of the attack is Community Psychiatry Management, LLC, which does business under the name Mindpath Health.  Email accounts were accessed by threat actors leading to the breach.  User data included Social Security number, date of birth, and medical information.  Letters of notice were sent to compromised users by Mindpath.  I believe this company was a target because the sensitivity of the data involved increased its value and the security posture of the company was poor.  The threat actor appears to have obtained the data via email records.  If this was truly the case, why was sensitive data being sent internally through email?  Humans are the weakest link in any organization's security; however, properly implemented defense in depth could have reduced the severity of this breach.  For example, HIPAA information should not be sent via email.  It should be stored in an environment which requires another means of authorization.  In terms of governance and policies, members of the organization should have been trained to recognize phishing attempts, forced to rotate passwords on a more frequent basis, and not send private information via insecure email.  The security operations center should also be monitoring user activity and flagging anomalous activity/access.  The article states that Mindpath used a contractor to conduct an investigation post after the fact.  This indicates that a small or non-existent internal SOC.  Mindpath was doing very little to protect their patients' data.  In my opinion, the cost of being out of compliance for healthcare institutions should be much higher for the healthcare providers.  Customers are now potential subjects for identity theft and all they have gotten so far is a notice of that fact.  A wilder thought is this is just one of many healthcare institutions where this type of incident occured in 2023 so far.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights keeps record of reported breaches on their website and the amount of small healthcare organizations involved in breaches is disheartening.  I know my local doctor's office is probably ill-equipped.  What is your healthcare provider doing to protect your data?  Paying for insurance in lieu of standing up a SOC?

To prevent future attacks, Mindpath should train its employees to combat common social engineering tactics.  In terms of triple A, employees should have limited access to patient data and passwords should be rotated frequently.  Since the analysis was done post-mortem, Mindpath's DiD is probably minimal and passive.  They should establish an internal SOC, create a separate environment for sensitive data, monitor user access, and enforce the aformentioned policies when it comes to account management.  Unfortunately, people are the most common point of failure.  It is for this reason that we should promote better security awareness.  We can only protect eachother if we are well informed.
