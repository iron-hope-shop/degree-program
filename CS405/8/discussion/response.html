        With the increase of users utilizing mobile devices to access proprietary networks, ensuring that the user is in fact who they say they are has become increasingly important.  Employing an authentication topology that verifies every device every time they attempt to access an application (without impacting performance) is the challenge this concept presents.

        It is an insanely impossible task to do this without layered security practices.  Zero trust does not just stop upon application access.  It applies to any time a subject (user) accesses an object (resource).  We should incorporate least privilege when granting access to any object.

        Latency in application access/authentication could be enough to have the user looking for other options.

        I tend to disagree with this.  Sign sign-on (OAuth or SAML) allow users to authenticate via a third party for federated identity.  So for example, when I sign into a new app on my phone I can use Google's federation to verify my identity and <b>instead of manually creating an entirely new account, my resources are associated with a pre-existing source of truth</b>.  That saves users a significant amount of time and honestly, when properly implemented, do not affect application load time significantly.

        Having the whole development team understand the impact of malicious users inside the network could help them to realize the importance of zero trust.

        Developers outside of any organization's InfoSec are usually blisfully unaware of security best practice.  It is often intimidating to them and a common excuse is that they have deliverables and learning these principles will slow down their work.  We need to be advocates for our organization's security policy despite the sub-organization we land in (i.e. outside of InfoSec/SOC/SIRT); furthermore, filling in those gaps and teaching other developers about security best practices will drastically improve the organization's overall security stance.
