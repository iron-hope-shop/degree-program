# Review the use cases that your classmate described. How well did they capture the functionality of an ATM?
Card reading for the technician's access into the actual ATM unit is something I did not see happening.  I guess I just thought they would be able to remotely activate some service mode or something.  Anyway, I think that the only issue I see in your use cases to capture the functionality of an ATM is that the "Check credentials/PIN" is not really a use case.  I mean to say it is just a required function of the operation of the ATM but not the reason someone would approach the ATM.  The PIN would be changed via some other direct interaction with the bank, right?  Or am I missing something?
