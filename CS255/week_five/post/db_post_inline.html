        Behavioral, functional, and structural modeling are all ways to view information systems; therefore, they are related in that way.
        <!-- UPDATE -->
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        Systems analysts use functional models to describe the external behavioral view of an information system, and they use structural models to depict the static view of an information system (Dennis, Tegarden, & Wixom, 2012).  Behavioral models are focused around the variability within an information system such as states.  Together these models help to outline the intricacies of the system in such a way that technical and non-technical team members can understand and apply them.

        If I were creating a function model for an ATM the use cases for the system would be for a customer of the bank (with an ATM card) to withdraw money, deposit money, and check their balance(s).
        <!-- UPDATE -->

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        For the use cases above the following objects would be needed for the ATM system: a customer, an ATM, a central bank system, and banking information.
