# How is behavioral modeling related to functional and structural modeling?
Behavioral, functional, and structural modeling are all ways to view information systems; therefore, they are related in that way.

# How do functional, structural, and behavioral models work together to describe a whole system?
Systems analysts use functional models to describe the external behavioral view of an information system, and they use structural models to depict the static view of an information system (Dennis, Tegarden, & Wixom, 2012).  Behavioral models are focused around the variability within an information system such as states.  Together these models help to outline the intricacies of the system in such a way that technical and non-technical team members can understand and apply them.

# Think about an ATM and its functionality. If you were creating a functional model for an ATM, what would be the use cases for that system?
If I were creating a function model for an ATM the use cases for the system would be for a customer of the bank (with an ATM card) to withdraw money, deposit money, and check their balance(s).

# Note: You do not need to create a functional model or diagram. You may just describe the use cases.


# Based on the use cases you described, what objects might you need for an ATM system?
For the use cases above the following objects would be needed for the ATM system: a customer, an ATM, a central bank system, and banking information.
