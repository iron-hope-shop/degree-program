        You raised a really great point with your comment about how in order to be ethical data collectors, security is necessary to prevent that data from being misused. I would consider using dummy data whenever possible in testing to mitigate the chances of data being leaked. When looking at your method of collecting requirements, I thought that the method you described was a great way to help prevent any miscommunication between the development team and the client.

        There are a lot of tools available for synthesyzing data and you can mimick PII from SSNs to medical records!  What a time to be alive!  Thanks for the positive feedback!
