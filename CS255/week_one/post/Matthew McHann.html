        I began in server ops so I am intimately familiar with *nix and NT; however, I have transitioned into cloud as of last year.  I am pretty obsessed with kubernetes and containerization in general so I have adopted that and it is heavily reflected in my work.

        How has your job helped you in your course work?

        I would say that problem-solving to survive (for a livelihood) has changed me and a lot of my coursework is made easier through my work experience.  For instance, when I moved to security I picked up Java in the first few weeks and then I had my first Java course in SNHU months later.  Let's just say I pretty much had Java down at that point!
