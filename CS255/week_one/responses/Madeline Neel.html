        Collecting requirements has become easier due to technology. I remember briefly learning about this in a previous class but there are websites/apps that allow real time updates that so that anyone involved can look at where they are in the project and what has been completed. In situations that a requirement is missing or needs to change, the stakeholders can easily contact and reevaluate their needs. Overall, technology allows better communication between the developers and client.

        This is so true!  My team uses JIRA which is a third-party software used, in part, for project management.  We use an agile methodology called Scrum rather than the traditional waterfall.  This consists of sprint planning meetings where we determine business needs followed by sprints.  For us, sprints are two weeks (other than the first sprint of a fiscal year which we call sprint 0 and it lasts only 1 week).  We have our projects organized as "epics" within JIRA and have further broken them down into "stories" which are tasks that can be completed in enough time to fit them into a sprint.  Usually these stories are bite-sized and we take on a handful apiece per sprint.  I tend to believe waterfall has mostly been phased out of mainstream usage based on hearing others speak about their jobs, etc.
