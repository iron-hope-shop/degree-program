        ... always loved making music on software like fruity loops studio, garage band, etc. I just recently got into coding because my girlfriend. She works as a graphic/visual designer for a home automation company called "Savant". I have a lot of ideas for app's I would like to build in the future. Right now I am a carpenter working for my father. I enjoy snowboarding, skateboarding, PC gaming, and hanging out with friends. My favorite course in computer science so far has been computer graphics and visualization. I really like the coding shapes and creating an environment that you can move around in and explore.

        Avoid or minimize anything that will cause physical or emotional harm to participants. Make participants aware of any potential harms prior to their participation. Try to remain neutral and unbiased. Don't let your personal preconceptions or opinions interfere with the data collection process.

        This is a good approach to ethical programming/design.  The antithesis of this would be companies selling user data to third-parties and using it to manipulate users.  Ethical data science is going to grow a lot within the next few years, methinks.

        I would choose to collect requirements by talking in person and having a conversation. Interviewing is one of the primary ways analysts gather information about an information systems project. Early in a project, an analyst may spend a large amount of time interviewing people about their work, the information they use to do it, and the types of information processing that might supplement their work.

        It's certainly important to be on the same page as YOUR customer (remember, your customer isn't nessicarily the end user) and the best way of doing this is by gaining a deep understanding of the vision.
