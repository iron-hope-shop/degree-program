        Yes, I have definitely interacted with systems that had very clear bugs in them. I had an issue once where I was submitting a form and it wasn't going through, but i had no indication of anything that went wrong. I used the chat support to talk with someone. They mentioned that i probably wasn't meeting the password criteria and they were right. It was good to be able to get a fast result like that. The situation could have been improved if the form had better UX and displayed what was the issue with the input data.

        I have most certainly experienced this; however, on the other side!  I used to have to answer phonecalls about stuff like this and we eventually got a message out with ann organized list of password requirements.  That took care of the majority of the calls but those were dark times indeed.

        I would use a JIRA board to keep track of incoming maintenance tickets, so that support staff could easily write details of how to replicate the issue, and developers could easily tract the priority of each one.

        JIRA is a great way to track work intake.  I have recently converted my team from using ServiceNow to JIRA only because I hate ServiceNow and favor JIRA.  I like how JIRA is organized and broken down into stories and epics for project manangement as well.
