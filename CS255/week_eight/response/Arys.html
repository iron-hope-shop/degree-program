        Your UML diagram differs from mine greatly.  Mine was super short... but I did choose a different use case.  I like how you have organized the diagram and employed the proper symbols.  One thing that could be improved is adding seperate diagrams of other processes if they are mentioned but that seems like a lot of extra work!  I probably would have left those out.

        I agree that "multiple teams would be the better option most the times."  From my experience, the teams who specialize in this know what to look for and are great at their jobs.  Like you said they also have a lot to contribute from an enntirely different perspective and ask thought-provoking questions.
