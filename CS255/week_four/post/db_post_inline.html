        Object Models and Gantt Charts

        Object modeling is important for system analysis and design to outline entities, rules, and behaviors easily described by humans into a format we can translate to an application architecture.

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        The object-oriented concepts of encapsulation and polymorphism are related to abstraction within object models.  For instance, we are able to encapsulate internal implementation details of an object from its external view and that same operation may apply to two or more classes in different ways (Valacich, 2019).

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        The main differences between and object and a process model are the level of abstraction and purpose.  Process models are higher-level diagrams which portray a logic flow of a system; meanwhile, an object model for the same system would be a more specific outline of the functions and data within the same individual processes.

        The benefits I see in using a Gantt chart for scheduling purposes is the ease of use.  The chart ended up being very easy to look at and understand.  It also has a very practical use and I think I would consider using this method in the real world for planning.

        My struggles with creating a Gantt chart were mostly limited to user error.  I have used lucid chart a lot at work but for some reason I had a licensing issue so I was not able to use the same template as the example.  Despite that, I believe my Gantt chart turned out okay:
