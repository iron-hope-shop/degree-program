# Analyze the differences between process and object models and pose additional questions and comments based on your analysis of these two models.
I think that process and object models are tools for us, as engineers, to remember the vision of the project.  Most likely, we will require more than an object or a process model.  They aid in creating systems and planning but neither captures the entirety of what is required. We will need both types of models and direct interaction with the customer/product owner or a list of their requirements in order to best align with the vision of the project.

# What similarities and differences do you see between your Gantt chart and your classmateâ€™s?
I really like how you made your Gantt chart.  I was going to list individual calendar days but I thought it would end up too... long.  But it probably looks better than mine, you made it look good!

# Share a strategy that might help your classmate overcome the challenge they experienced.
I think the most challenging part of creating a Gantt chart for myself was not being entirely sure which members of the team were supposed to be working on each task.  Based on the documentation, there were only a few tasks where a specific person was named as the person responsible for that task.

I totally omitted specific task owners in mine.  In my opinion that is a little too details for our needs.  I am accustomed to creating stories/tasks as they are needed and then they get assigned to a teammate during planning in the prior week (in the form of, "Hey Greg I made a story to update XYZ, do you want it?" "Sure I can do that within the next couple weeks.").  I guess I just assumed something similar would be happening here, oops!
