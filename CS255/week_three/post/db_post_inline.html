    Process modeling involves graphically representing the functions, or processes, that capture, manipulate, store, and distribute data between a system and its environment and between components within a system.

    Process models are typically used in system design to organize the logical or physical flow of existing elements and procedures.  With a clear view of these two aspects of the system, planning for improvement or maintenance can commence.

    The concept of DFD completeness refers to whether you have included in your DFDs all of the components necessary for the system you are model-ing. If your DFD contains data flows that do not lead anywhere or data stores, pro-cesses, or external entities that are not connected to anything else, your DFD is not complete.

    I believe that the completeness guideline for drawing data flow diagrams (DFDs) is most important for creating a good process model.  This is because without completeness, the other guidelines would be deprived of practical significance.

    To decompose the process of "[Completing] Project One" I would begin with the interview transcript as a source of data.  Data then flows into the student's process of meeting project requirements.  That process feeds into a data store which is the business requirements document.  The same process feeds into the model application short paper, which is also a data store.  The business requirements and model application documents are the two deliverables.
