        Completeness is the most important aspect for starting the drawing, because if you have all the elements, demands and qualities of a system considered, all the problems you will deal with will be inside the possibilities you can know, while if you are dealing with an incomplete system, then a problem must be out of your reach, because it is a cause of the incompleteness of the system.

        I also chose completeness as the most important guideline for DFD diagrams because without completeness, the other guidelines would be deprived of practical significance.  You could continue to solve issues with the model ad infinitum because all of the variables and constants of the system would never be considered.  It is only once you realize completeness that you are able to provide a homogeneous system.

        Our descriptions differed in terms of scope.  I think yours focused more on the general process of turning in the project and mine focused on the fourth step of yours.  I broke down the process of meeting the deliverable requirements more specifically.  The complete process model is probably outlined by joining both of our models.
