        I think that completeness is the most important guideline for drawing DFDs. Completeness is important because the whole point of DFDs is to better comprehend the system and if a DFD is lacking in completeness it cannot serve that purpose effectively.

        I agree that completeness is important for drawing DFDs because you will <u>never</u> achieve the correct process model by neglecting this guideline.

        To decompose the process "Complete Project One" I would break it down into sub-processes. In this case two sub-processes might be "Complete the business requirements document" and "Create a Gantt chart". These two sub-processes could be in parallel to each other because they are both necessary to complete project one but not dependent upon each other. The "Complete the business requirements document" process could be broken down further into each sub heading that needs to be completed.

        Our decompositions differed because yours is higher level and describes the process of actually decomposing the process.  Mine was more focused on the process of meeting project requirements and how to achieve that.
