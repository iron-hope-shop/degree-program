It is great how you broke down the system into high-level business needs.  I think that was the clearest part of your description.  One improvement could be added in the form of the specific requirements of the parties involved; however, I like how simple and concise your description currently is.  I did not notice any technical jargon which is a plus when dealing with management and vendors.
