        I enjoyed the formatting of your post.  It seems like a real email I would read at work.  You did great!  I don't think there was any part of your description that <i>wasn't</i> clear so it's hard to choose the "clearest" part.  One thing that could be improved is reducing the verbiage in your description paragraph; although, I'm not sure how you would do this without omitting details.  I think it's probably overkill here but in the real world I may bounce an email like this off of a teammate and learn that what I thought was a simple description is actually not simple enough.  So simplifying it further may help where possible.  I did not see any technical jargon-- in my opinion-- great job!
