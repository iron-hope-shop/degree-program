    The different actors in our system design are customers, drivers, administrators.  The different use cases for our system are numerous.

    The customer is an end user who is purchasing services from DriverPass.  This actor will be able to perform numerous actions which will all involve the centralized database.  For the purpose of this outline assume that the user is already successfully registered and logged in.  Based on their role they have been routed to the generic user homepage.  The first use case is that customers resetting their password.  The second use case for customers is that they can view, create, modify, and delete their appointments online.  The customer will also be able to take practice tests online via the website.

    Drivers are DriverPass associates tasked with providing on-the-road training to customers.  Drivers have the requirement of interacting with our website to view their daily appointment schedule.

    Administrators are the management and support team from DriverPass who require special privileges in order to view, edit, modify, and delete sensitive data within the application.  Administrators need to be able to track which driver the customer is scheduled to go out with and record the time and car used as well.  The customer makes appointments based on a package system and DriverPass administrators should be able to perform an action to disable a package.  Essentially, the administrators should be able to perform any actions that the customer and driver are able to as well as modify or delete any data stored.
