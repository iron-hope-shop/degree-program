        The similarities I notice between my design and yours are some of the use cases.  For instance, the registration use case and setting up appointments.  I like that you included setting up the appointment via phone.  I should have done that!  Apart from that our differences are numerous.  It looks like you broke down the use cases much more granularly than I did.  To improve the design, although I can't really say anything, you might add the includes inline with arrows rather than as shapes.  I thought the "--&lt;&lt;includes&gt;&gt;-->" was some sort of standard.  Also, be colorful!  It may be extra work but I think your viewer will appreciate it.
