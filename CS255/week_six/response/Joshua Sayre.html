        Our desgins have very similar use cases.  I like that you used color for the use cases.  One striking difference between my design and yours is the DMV info source actor.  I thought it was interesting to add that and I probably should have done something similar.  One thing that can be improved in your design is the dashed arrows.  I assume they represent "includes" or "extends."  They should look something like "--&lt;&lt;includes&gt;&gt;-->" or "--&lt;&lt;extends&gt;&gt;-->" so viewers get a better understanding when initially looking upon your diagram.
