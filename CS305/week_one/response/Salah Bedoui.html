        Exploits like these are targeting the same types of industries so they will probably be similar in nature; however, the attack vectors could range from SQL injection to compromised accounts.

        The article suggests that some of the organaizations are not focused enough on fighting these threats (mainly because of insurances paying any potential fines), others suffered the impacts of this kind of attacks facing multiple investigations and lawsuits, and in some cases bunkruptcy.

        The nuances for this type of organization are that this healthcare data is highly sensitive and often protected by law.  Additionally, as you said, some of the organizations are not focused on fighting these threats because insurance will pay for compliance fines.  This type of threat might be relevant for healthcare because they are "easy" targets and contain very valuable data.  These hackers are selling the the highest bidder and the healthcare industry is a low hanging yet very ripe fruit.
