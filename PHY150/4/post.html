        Above you can see my free-body diagram for a finger mashing a button on a keyboard.  In this case the finger is trying to nab a sweet deal on a Playstation 5 by spamming refresh.  The Newton's Third Law of force pair in this example is the force the finger applies to the keyboard is equal and opposite to the force the keyboard applies to the finger.  The key which force is applying to will become depressed as the finger collides with it.  The finger stops moving and the person feels a force upon the tip of their finger.  These prove that Newton's third law is in action!
