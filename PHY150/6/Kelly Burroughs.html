        Energy transfers are present in our everyday lives, one that comes to mind for me is when I turn on the fan in my room every night before I get in bed. In this instance, electrical energy is transformed into mechanical energy when the power from the electrical plug begins to make the fan rotate and blow air. The amount of energy that is transferred depends on what speed I decide to set the fan at. This process does follow the law of conservation of energy. The existing electrical energy from the outlet is transferred into mechanical energy. The energy is not being created in this process, it already exists and is being transferred.

        Additional energy transfers would be via heat from the blades of the fan to the air around it.  The kinetic energy in the fan blades are met by air and thus by air resistance.  This opposing force would produce heat; however, the heat may be dissipated quickly as a result of windchill.
