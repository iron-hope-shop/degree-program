        For this discussion â€“ conservation of Energy I decided to go with my commute to work. I drive to work, my vehicle burns gas to get the vehicle moving. This is an example of conserving chemical energy into mechanical energy. The energy form gasoline is combined with the air and is combusted in the engine which will provide the vehicle with the kinetic energy and gets the vehicle into motion. This process can be described as the transfer of the chemical energy that is in gasoline into mechanical energy in the vehicle.

        When the combustion engine turns the crankshaft, a pulley will also turn the alternator.  Alternators generate electricity from machinical energy.  The electrical energy produced is stored in the car's battery and helps to run interior and exterior electrical components.  Going back to the initial post, where the tires meet the ground the vehicle will encounter friction.  That means some of the chemical -> mechanical eneergy will be lost as a result.  This energy is disappated as heat.  Components within the vehicle's transmission also physically transfer energy but friction is minimized by grease and oil.
