# There are many examples of energy transfer within your daily routine, such as the transfer of chemical energy stored in the food that you eat to chemical energy that your cells can use (ATP), fuel chemical energy in gasoline to kinetic energy to make your vehicle move, or converting electrical potential energy to energy that can light up the screen of an electronic device.

# Choose an example from your personal experience and explain the energy transfers and transformations that are taking place.
An example of energy from my personal experience is a battery.  I handle AA batteries all of the time because I have kids!  Double A batteries turn chemical energy into electrical energy.  Different materials are packed together as plates and the flow of electrons creates and electical current!  The transfer of this energy obeys the law of conservation of energy; however, batteries are not entirely efficient.  As most of us know, batteries can get pretty warm.  This is especially true for larger, higher voltage/amperage, batteries such as those in laptops. This is because the chemical reaction is exothermic, releasing thermal energy as a result of the process.

# Do the energy transfers obey the law of conservation of energy? Explain your rationale.




# Describe additional energy transfers that could have been identified.
When the combustion engine turns the crankshaft, a pulley will also turn the alternator.  Alternators generate electricity from machinical energy.  The electrical energy produced is stored in the car's battery and helps to run interior and exterior electrical components.  Going back to the initial post, where the tires meet the ground the vehicle will encounter friction.  That means some of the chemical -> mechanical eneergy will be lost as a result.  This energy is disappated as heat.  Components within the vehicle's transmission also physically transfer energy but friction is minimized by grease and oil.

# Describe any additional types of energy that are being produced.
