        An example of energy from my personal experience is a battery.  I handle AA batteries all of the time because I have kids!  Double A batteries turn chemical energy into electrical energy.  Different materials are packed together as plates and the flow of electrons creates and electical current!  The transfer of this energy obeys the law of conservation of energy; however, batteries are not entirely efficient.  As most of us know, batteries can get pretty warm.  This is especially true for larger, higher voltage/amperage, batteries such as those in laptops. This is because the chemical reaction is exothermic, releasing thermal energy as a result of the process.
