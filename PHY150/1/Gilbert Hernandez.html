        Every weekday I drive my wife to work and back, this action of driving and the mechanics of a car uses speed, velocity, and acceleration to get to work. Speed represents how fast I am driving my wife to work, velocity is measuring the speed and direction I am traveling to get her to work, and acceleration represents the change my vehicle goes through in velocity. Acceleration happens when I start my car and pull out of my garage, when my vehicle stops at a light and starts again, and an increase or decrease in speed when driving straight and turning.

        Nice to virtually meet you!  A factor that would impact the speed, velocity, or acceleration of your drive would be a duck.  Imagine you are driving down the road and suddenly a mommy duck waddles across the road followed by her ducklings.  Hesitantly, you decelerate, decreasing your speed and the magnitude of your velocity.  Your wife would frown upon ruining perfectly good ducks so naturally you slow down and come to a stop.  The speed and magnitude of your velocity reaches zero.   The ducks pass.  You both make it to work late but the world is a few ducks the richer.
