        Hello, my name is Brad and I am 28 years old.  I am the proud father of four children and proud husband to a beautiful wife.  I currently work as an Advanced Systems Engineer in Information Security for Walmart Associates, Inc.  Most of my projects revolve around different applications of machine learning.  I am enrolled in the bachelors program for computer science with a focus in cybersecurity.

        Something I have to do recently is work from the office two days a week (yay).  The drive is about 15 miles.  I start from a standstill in the driveway.  I accelerate backward to exit the driveway and again forward to begin my journey.  After some acceleration I achieve a constant speed and usually I put on the cruise control.  Speed is scalar value which means it can be quantified by a number.  Acceleration is described by a value and a direction (a vector).  There is no road which goes straight from my house to the office.  The road toward my target (the office) is very curvy so while I may be able to maintain a constant speed, I am not always making progress in a straight line relative to my starting point.  For example, during one part of my journey I travel a few miles directly east and then a couple more miles due north.  The rate of change of my velocity is my acceleration.  Through the corners and hills I am constantly changing acceleration (even if cruise control is on) to maintain a certain speed.
