        My name is Tim, I am currently a project manager for a manufacturer company in WI.  I am striving to for a CS degree with a concentration in Software engineering. I served 14 years in the Navy as a Master at Arms but now I live in WI with my wife and baby boy.

        Well while traveling my velocity is a straight line with little deviation in my vector.  I maintain a constant speed of about 35 MPH with about 5 decelerations and 6 accelerations. So speed is a form of time keeping while velocity is the direction in which the speed is going.

        I would say this is a pretty accurate description!  You did not mention your mode of transportation or your destination so I am going to assume your Navy training allows you to run at superhuman speeds.  Running faster than Usain Bolt toward your next mark makes you hungry.  You see a child walking near the street you are running on.  Normally a runner would slow down in order to recieve an item from a passerby but you are no ordinary man.  The child offers his ice cream to you willingly as you decelerate through a corner, grabbing that sweet rocky road in the process.  The magnitude of your speed decreases and your direction changes as well.  At the precise apex of the turn you down the ice cream and kick it into high gear.  The ice cream helps you accelerate and maintain your speed, and since you are now in your final strait toward your target your velocity is positive.
