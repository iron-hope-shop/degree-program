# Blackboard Templates
HTML templates for Blackboard posts/replies
OH, and it should be compliant with APA 6 formatting.  For example, the references sections are wrapped with CSS that will give them hanging indents.  You'll still need to make sure the titles of articles are in italics. If not, let me know.
## POST (You can add more paragraph, references, etc.)

## REPLY (you can add more quotes, paragraphs, references, etc.)
![REPLY](/img/db_reply.PNG)


## Purpose
I wasn't keen on using the built-in formatting options and transferring my work from one medium (MS Word, LibreOffice, etc.) was not working because Blackboard uses rich-text formatting.  Editing these files has been a lot more efficient for me than worrying about the formatting of my posts each time I work on my homework.

## How to use
In the root directory of this project, you will find two HTML files.  * db_post.html - This is for 'FIRSTNAME LASTNAME MAIN POST'
* db_reply.html - This is for responding to posts.  It includes blockquotes

### Creating a post/reply
Once you have chosen a template, I recommend editing it in notepad or another text editor.

### Add the HTML to the post/reply
![Creation](/img/tutorial_1.png)

To add the template to your post/reply, click the HTML button in the toolbar.


![Edit](/img/tutorial_2.png)

If you have no already edited the template, this would probably be the second easiest place to do so (the easiest being in an external editor).


![Update](/img/tutorial_3.png)

Now click the update button and vee-oh-lah.  If you are finished, submit it; otherwise, you can click preview to check out how it will look when it is submitted.
