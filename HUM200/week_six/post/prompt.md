# This week, we are exploring the relevance (i.e., the impact) of the humanities. How can the perspective of the humanities have a positive impact on your current or future professional career? That is, how can you make use of these principles at your work?

The perspective of the humanities can have a positive impact on my current or future professional career by providing insight and understanding.  The principles we have used most so far in the humanities-- that is: observation, critical thinking, and writing/organization-- can be applied to my career and daily life.  To gain insight on something you have to observe it and learn about its background.  The same can be said when analyzing a painting.  To appreciate that same painting you have seek answers to questions that you may have and understand how it affects you.  In order to convey these observations and theories, you must organize the information or write it down.  This process holds true in daily work as well as the humanities.  Every day at most jobs is defined by obeservation, critical thinking, and writing/organization.
