# In response to your peers, comment on the posts of two classmates who have found that the humanities benefited them in a different way.

# Explain if these benefits are universal or specific to a certain kind of field. 


# Could the benefits your peers found aid you in your job? Why or why not?
Thanks for the interesting interpretation of the humanities and its relation to your career.  Observational and analyical skills are certainly a part of the humanities and can be seen as a universal benefit.  I employ these skills in my daily work so if our study of humanities has improved my ability to execute these tasks, then it will aid my in my current job.
