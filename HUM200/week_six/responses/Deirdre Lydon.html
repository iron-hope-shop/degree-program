        With humanities, observation and analytical skills are used to their greatest degree. In the medical field, analyzing is key to giving a patient the greatest outcome. Visually we look at scans and X-rays, utilizing visual art observation skills. We look at an image meticulously to find any abnormality or detail contributing to the patient's condition. We chart and write notes about patient's progress as well as reading other people's notes, utilizing literary skills to understand the full picture and trend of the patient. Lastly, we listen to our patient and observe overall body language. All of these make a great clinician and transfer in to our humanities studies, which was a pleasant surprise to me as the class progresses.

        Thanks for the interesting interpretation of the humanities and its relation to your career.  Observational and analyical skills are certainly a part of the humanities and can be seen as a universal benefit.  I employ these skills in my daily work so if our study of humanities has improved my ability to execute these tasks, then it will aid my in my current job.
