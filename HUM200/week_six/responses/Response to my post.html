        I am currently designated as a systems engineer in Walmart's InfoSec division, although I have been doing more software development than anything.  Ideally I will become a principal engineer and guide associates on their projects until completion.

        Observation  and critical thinking I know will be beneficial for my future career path. I did not think about the writing and organization but I can see how they would be skills used in humanities and I can for sure see how it will relate to my field.

        What is your current/future career path?  I am happy that I was able to provide some original content!  I always worry about repeating what someone else has said in these discussions.
