        There are some sound leadership principles that are very much based on the 'soft skills' we learn to use in humanities courses.  Our hobbies and the games we play for example, both interest us to the point that we will invest a lot of time and energy into these things.

        As Dr. Hatch stated above, the soft skills that you described are definately a universal benefit of the humanities.  Learning about different interests and aspirations is critical in leadership roles; concurrently, it is beneficial when dealing with leaders.

        Before taking this course I no idea on what was in stored for me, but now I have come to realize that humanities are a part of a lot people life they just didn't know it. I was one of them but taking this course have made gain some patience. It has also taught me how to look at different items to get a better understanding.

        Soft skills such as patience and understanding are critical in the business world.  I have heard many people refer to soft skills and it is beneficial to find a sucessful mentor in your field who can guide you through your career.  From me experience, most engineers are introverts.  I am an engineer so generally keep a technical mentor as well as one who can help me better understand these soft skill in a business context.
