        Don’t throw in the towel too early because then you will miss out on the true meaning of what the humanities are and how impactful they are on our lives. Don’t assume that because your degree or career path doesn’t seem to benefit from this that it doesn’t. Humanities follows us throughout our education, career and life affecting all aspects of our thinking process. Although I started weak and wanting to give up, I pressed and found myself at the light at the end of the proverbial tunnel strong and with a completely different and positive perspective on the humanities.

        The struggle was real.  To complete the assignments on time and soak in their meaning is a good message.  A lot of the ideas expressed are microcosms of life and could apply to any career path.  Great advice!
