        The first couple of weeks in this class were very overwhelming with the number of pieces of art we were supposed to analyze. I found that what worked best for me was to pick one piece that I liked the most (or even a little in some cases) and really put my time and energy into trying to understand the historical context, the design, the author's intentions, etc. I found that by giving one piece, in particular, a lot of attention, I was able to better understand the concepts and skills being taught.

        This is a good idea.  Honestly, I kind of muddled through all of the analysis and my strategy wasn't very uniform.  It would have been cool if we could pick an artifact from a central repository of artifacts so that we could pick on that we were most interested in talking about and thus be more engaged.
