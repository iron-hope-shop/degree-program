        It is safe to say that "mastering" the humanities is something I will never achieve.  I did, however, get better at time management.  When I started this course I was afraid that investing time in it would cause me to neglect other aspects of my work.  Do not be afraid to stop and smell the roses!  The tasks in this class require you to commit time to slow down, appreciate artifacts, gain insight, and interpret their meaning.  Doing so will give you a satisfaction like nothing else.  My biggest takeaway from this course is that when you are creating something beautiful you can either use broad or fine strokes.  Take the time to go add meaningful details to anything you create.  If you keep doing this then you can effect the life of someone you least expect (perhaps a student 400 years in the future).
