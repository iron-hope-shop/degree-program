        I tried to explain the album American Idiot by Greenday to my friend. The album came out at a time where a lot of people did not agree with the wars we were in. My friend who only listened to hip hop at the time at first had a hard time recognizing the themes. I tried my best to relate the album to some works that existed in hip hop. Once this was done he had a easier time understanding the themes presented in the album. We were at the age where we were beginning to start forming educated opinions in politics and in life in general and the although I don't share a lot of the beliefs I did back then cannot deny the impact it had on me and my friends back when it released.

        I have heard songs from this album at some point in my life; however, I'm not sure how war has anything to do with them.  If you had included snippets of lyrics from some of the songs on the album I would have had a better understanding of the subject and be able to relate it to your impact statement.
