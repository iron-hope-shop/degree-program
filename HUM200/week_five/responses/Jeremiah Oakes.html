        I hope you are also enjoying your quarantine!  I'm losing my mind working from home and it just got extended to May!  Hooray!

        In order to best explain it to her I broke it down into the main characters, and went from there. I also used a lot of animation in my voice, so I felt like she really wanted to see the show after I explained how CRAZY it is.

        I think at this point most of us have probably seen the series but it might help to include part of your explaination to your aunt in your post.  This would help readers who are unfamiliar with this <b>hilarious</b> series get a grasp of the main concepts and what the impact truly is.
