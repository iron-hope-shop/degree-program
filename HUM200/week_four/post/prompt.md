# Compared to what you know about the methods of disciplines such as mathematics, the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry), or the social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology), what do you think is unique about the methods used to investigate the humanities?

In exploring the process of analyzing works from the the humanities and researching specific works for my project, I have noticed a trend.  The trend in humanities research seems to be using our senses to interpret meaning and determine themes.  This spans the different sectors of the humanities including, visual art, literature, and music.  The process of identifying these themes, however, is different based on the subject.  When finding the theme in visual art or literature the student uses their sight.  In music, the student uses their hearing.  The use of my senses other than reading conprehension to identify patterns is one of my weaknesses.  I have not been asked to flex these muscles very much in the real world and it is both refreshing and interesting to hone them.  I have learned a lot through the guided text as well as the research for my project on tying together sensory data to define themes.
