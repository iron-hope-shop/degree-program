        While certain aspects of art, like historical and cultural context, is quantifiable data that helps us to analyze pieces of art, it does not present the whole picture. Art is uniquely human in how it encompasses both data and feelings. Style, intention, and passion are not quantifiable and I believe that is what sets the humanities apart from the hard and social sciences.

        This is something that rings true with me as well.  I also noticed that most of the humanities involves intrepreting the way that art makes you feel on top of what is already established by past observers/students of the humanities.  This is challenging to me because I prefer logic and structure over chaos but somehow I am managing.  Fortunately most of my work is software development which is not too random and mostly makes sense to me.  Good hunting and great post!
