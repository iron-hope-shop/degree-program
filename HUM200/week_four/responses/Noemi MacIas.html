        While working through this course I have found that Huminites requires more research, time and patience, of course this has been my own personal experience. Social Sciences also requires these things but in a different manner.

        I concur with this on a spiritual level.  The guided textbook has certainly tried my patience!

        You do this by considering and studying the piece at hand first, formulating your initial impressions. Throughout your time with any piece you will look over or re-read the pieces multiple times, do research on the artist, examine the time period in which it was created and also consider perspectives from other researchers on said piece. All in all, you can spend hours upon hours studying a work of art and questioning its meaning and why the artist created it.

        While doing these analyses on artifacts I also noticed that you must form your own thought which, for me, is often completely outside of the bounds of traditional analysis on the subject.  For instance, I examined a lot of the paintings and related them to my personal experience which landed me a little tangintial to the established theme of the painting.
