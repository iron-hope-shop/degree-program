        Hello, my name is Brad.  I am from Sugar Land, Texas and I currently reside in Northwest Arkansas.  I work for the Walmart Homeoffice - Information Security.  My major is computer science and I hope to gain any and all applicable knowledge that this course has to provide regarding my major and my career.  I tend to appreciate art in its many forms and, in my opinion, pondering art is meditative.

        Of the three three focal points of Week One (visual art, literature, or music), I am most comfortable with music.  I hold music in high regard and ever since my first mp3 player (an iPod classic), I have explored the wonderful world of music and delighted in what it has to offer.  I listen to the whole spectrum of genres.  I have the most experience with music, having dabbled in music production.  I find that visual art the most challenging art to understand because it is apparently subjective.  This is opposed to reading a book, which is written a certain way and conforms to a linguistic standard, whereas visual art can use a medium but have infinite meanings.
