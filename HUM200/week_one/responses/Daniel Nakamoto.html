        I'm Daniel, and I'm from New Hampshire. I'm currently studying to acquire my BA in Game Design and Programming. Recently, I had a life altering sickness that resulted in a three week hospitalization that included a week on life support.

        Hi Daniel.  Glad to have you with us!  I have always been interested in game design but there is just some abstractions in writing an engine that I have a hard time wrapping my head around.  Best of luck and I hope you truly enjoy it!

        Memories of events that never happened, and realities that felt like dreams mixed together before a muddled mind as if asking to be untangled. To me it was more of a visual art, clearly envisioned with my mind's eye... by far the only focal point within the humanities of which I can lay any claim to competence.

        This certainly is a unique perspective on visual art.  I definately have had some weird dreams but they never leaked into my memories.  This is something that I wish I could understand completely but at the same time I never hope I have to!

        However, amongst the true humanities, the only experience I have is in music, and only in the most basic of exposures.

        I think most people nowaday fill gaps in their time with music.  What kind of music do you listen to?
