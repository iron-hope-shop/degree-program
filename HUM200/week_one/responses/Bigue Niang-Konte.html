        My name is Bigue (Bee-Gay for the pronunciation) and I leave in Massachusetts near Boston. I moved from France to the United States since June 2018 to finally have my family reunited.

        I’m more comfortable with visual art, because I like it; I think it is very interesting and stimulates my brain by making me think deeply. It is also inspiring and often beautiful to look at. For example, I like paintings and sculptures. However, it’s the most challenging to understand because of its subjectivity. Artists can sometimes create very complicated artifacts that are uneasy to interpret; for instance, some abstract painting of Pablo Picasso mostly characterized by a combination of geometrical shapes. In this case, you usually have to do some research about it to have a better understanding of it.

        It is certainly more easy to quanify visual art, especially sculptures because they are tangible objects.  I agree that some artifacts such as abstract paintings are hard to interpret.  Maybe the best way to interpret them is emotion or perhaps a high-level analysis is best.

        Music, because it’s one of my first choices of distraction. I usually listen to various type of music, originating from almost every corner of the world and I truly appreciate them.

        Your perspective on music as a distraction is interesting.  I have always used music as a metronome to guide my work.  Albeit, there are some types of music you just can't focus while listening to.
