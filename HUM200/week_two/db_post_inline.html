        My first artifact is Three Ages of Man, a painting by Titian.  It was painted around 1513 in Italy.
My second artifact is the painting The Ages of Woman and Death by Hans Baldung Grien.  It was painted between 1541 and 1544.

        My theme is the passage of time and its affect on the human physque.  This theme is seen in both works in different forms.  In Three Ages of Man, there are young children playing, a middle-aged man exhausted with a lover, and an old man pondering death.  In The Ages of Woman we see a child rolling about, a woman with a tear, an old woman who is stern, and a skeletal figure with an hourglass.

        The theme relates to my personal experience that with age comes understanding and inevitability.  I was once a child with aspirations and hopes and they have changed almost constantly throughout time.  Expectations have been lowered and reality understood.  I can only hope that with age comes more wisdom and some insight to the true meaning of existence and why it is bound by time.  The theme could be useful in a medical setting, to be used to identify the current state of a person's mindset or maturity.  For instance, in a psychiatrist's office this might be something that they encounter a lot.  The futility of existence when faced with the invitability of death.  It may be useful to understand this to provide some insight and guidance to troubled souls.  I can use open-access journals, the websites of the museums where the art is currently located, and historical accounts of the artwork.  These are relevant sources of information because they are scholarly and the latter would be first-hand.  I might ask the state of mind of the artist or the nature of the rest of their work.  Perhaps the experience that inspired this art to be created and it affect on their community.  I recently had a personal experience that put me in a dark space.  It is for this reason that I wish to understand the greater purpose of man on this world.
