        Part of being on life support are the drugs that used to ensure you don't wake up and suddenly pull out the tubes keeping you alive so a paralytic and a sedative are administered. The most common side effects of these drugs are mental troubles, incoherence, and control. One difficulty I have found over the past two weeks is that I am still unable to keep my attention focused on anything, even recreation, for any extended period of time. Couple that with my natural tendency towards procrastination and you get a great combination for a time sink.

        Well I certainly don't have as much going on as you from that perspective but I also think time is my greatest enemy.  I relate to being a procrastinator and motivation is hard to come by sometimes.

        I think the best we can do is try to make it better, I try to make a game of the discussion posts at least by formatting them in HTML (I have some templates made).  It adds an organizational aspect that satiates some weird need inside of me.
