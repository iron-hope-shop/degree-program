        Nothing has been too challenging thus far for me. There will always be a challenge come up and you need to try your best to be able to comprehend it. Learning the different ways humanities are in the world could be challenging because they can be in many different ways.

        Well I sure envy you!  I think time is what most people have said is the biggest hurdle here.  I agree that all we can do is try our best and adapt.  I try to adopt a Borg-ian approach to learning.  lol
