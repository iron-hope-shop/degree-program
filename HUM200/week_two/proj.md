Describe the cultural artifacts that you have chosen. Consider questions such as these in your response: What is the name or title of the artifact? Who is
the author or artist? What is the date or time period when the artifact was created? What is the cultural location or physical setting of the artifact? In
addition, you could consider including a photograph or image of each cultural artifact, if they are visual artifacts.



Identify at least one common theme that will serve as the framework of your exploration document. How is the theme expressed in your artifacts?



Reflect on how the theme you identified is related to your personal experience. For instance, you could discuss how the expression of the theme in your
cultural artifacts is connected to you personally.
