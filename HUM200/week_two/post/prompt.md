# In your discussion post, describe what has been challenging about getting through the course thus far, and explain what has helped you overcome that challenge. If you have a question for the other students, feel free to include it as part of your response.

Time management, comprehension, and responses have been challenging aspects of the course thus far.  Overcoming these challenges has been a learning experience in many ways.  I have learned that this course takes a lot more time than others; however, I stop and enjoy the little things as I peruse the textbook.  Procuring quality thoughts to serve in the textbook open-ended responses as well as the discussion responses is always a challenge to me.  Despite the difficulty, I enjoy learning about the humanities and look forward to becoming more cultured.

The amount of reading required for this course is ungodly.  At the same time we have covered a lot of ground so time management and comprehension go hand-in-hand.  It has been a challenege balancing life while really absorbing the meaning of the content.  For instance, the music section.  I spent probably 30 minutes alone listening to the tunes.

Coming up with stimulating original content for my peers to interact with is always challenging.  At first I was very reserved but I would say I have fully embraced it and I can get pretty candid.  What is your mindset when doing the response portion of the discussions?
