# Interpret your peer’s coefficient of determination. How does it compare with yours?
<!-- quote -->
The coefficient of determination of the model is 0.835. The statistic determines how well a model explains and predicts future outcomes. Coefficient of determination, also referred to as the "R-squared" helps measure the accuracy of the model. The closer the number is to 1, the better the relationship between the two variables.

<!-- paragraph -->
My coefficient of determination was 0.807, meaning that 80.7% of the variance in MPG can be explained by WT and HP.  Yours is slightly higher at 83.5%.  This means that your predictor variables had a stronger relationship to the response variable.

# How do the results of your peers’ t-tests compare with yours?
The coefficients of WT and HP in your trial were slightly higher than mine; however, we both came to the same conclusion that a significant linear relationship exists between the parameters and the outcome.

# Would you recommend this regression model to the car rental company? Why or why not?
I would recommend this regression model to the car rental company because be have determined that the predictor variables in our model are significant.
