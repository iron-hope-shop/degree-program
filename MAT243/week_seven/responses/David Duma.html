        The coefficient of determination of the model is 0.835. The statistic determines how well a model explains and predicts future outcomes. Coefficient of determination, also referred to as the "R-squared" helps measure the accuracy of the model. The closer the number is to 1, the better the relationship between the two variables.

        My coefficient of determination was 0.807, meaning that 80.7% of the variance in MPG can be explained by WT and HP.  Yours is slightly higher at 83.5%.  This means that your predictor variables had a stronger relationship to the response variable.

        The coefficients of WT and HP in your trial were slightly higher than mine; however, we both came to the same conclusion that a significant linear relationship exists between the parameters and the outcome.

        I would recommend this regression model to the car rental company because be have determined that the predictor variables in our model are significant.
