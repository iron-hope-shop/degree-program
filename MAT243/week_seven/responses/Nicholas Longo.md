# Interpret your peer’s coefficient of determination. How does it compare with yours?
<!-- quote -->
The coefficient of determination for this model is 0.831. This figure states how much total variance can be explained by this model, meaning 83.1% of the variance is explained with the model. The higher this number is, the better the model is. And the same applies to the adjusted coefficient of determination. A model that can explain 83.1% of the variability between two predictor variables and a response variable is a reasonable and stable model.

My coefficient of determination was 0.807, meaning that 80.7% of the variance in MPG can be explained by WT and HP.  Yours is slightly higher at 83.1%.  This means that your predictor variables had a stronger relationship to the response variable.

# How do the results of your peers’ t-tests compare with yours?
The coefficients of WT and HP in your trial were slightly higher than mine.  Both of our p-values were near zero so we both came to the same conclusion that a significant linear relationship exists between the parameters and the outcome.

# Would you recommend this regression model to the car rental company? Why or why not?

This formula remains a solid formula for rental car companies to use if fuel-efficiency is the goal.

<!-- paragraph -->
I concur that this model is accurate enough to present to the rental car company if these paramaters map well to their goals.
