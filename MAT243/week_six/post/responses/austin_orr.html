        The multiple regression equation is Y=37.2245−3.8241X1−0.0322X2.

        The predicted value of MPG for a car of 2,780 lbs and 225 horsepower based on your provided multiple regression model is 19.35 MPG.  The residual if a car with those properties achieved 18 MPG would be -1.35 MPG.  In this scenario, the car achieved 1.35 MPG less than expected.

        The coefficient of correlation of mpg vs. horsepower is -0.780816, and mpg vs. weight is -0.868498. Both the coefficients show a negative correlation and also have a strong correlation against mpg.

        Your correlation coefficients are similar to mine.  I found that, for my data, the coefficient of correlation between MPG and WT was -0.8638 and the coefficient between MPG and HP was -0.7758.  I also deduced that the correlation between MPG and WT is strong negative, while the correlation between MPG and HP is moderate negative.  I don't see where you determined the strengths of your correlations but I do not believe -0.7808 is a strong negative.  I think that |-0.80| would be the lower threshold for that.

        The car rental company can use this model to predict the pricing of the rental for a specific car by finding its mpg by using the weight and horsepower of the make and model.

        I think that this model is accurate considering the variables that it accounts for.  If the car rental company is only wanting a price model based on these statistics then I would offer them this model.
