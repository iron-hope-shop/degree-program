# Review your peer’s multiple regression model (#3 in their initial post). What is the predicted value of miles per gallon for a car that has 2.78 (2,780 lbs) weight and 225 horsepower? Suppose that this car achieves 18 miles per gallon, what is the residual based on this actual value and the value that is predicted using the regression equation?

The multiple regression equation is Y=37.2245−3.8241X1−0.0322X2.

The predicted value of MPG for a car of 2,780 lbs and 225 horsepower based on your provided multiple regression model is 19.35 MPG.  The residual if a car with those properties achieved 18 MPG would be -1.35 MPG.  In this scenario, the car achieved 1.35 MPG less than expected.

# How do the plots and correlation coefficients of your peers compare with yours?
<!-- quote -->
The coefficient of correlation of mpg vs. horsepower is -0.780816, and mpg vs. weight is -0.868498. Both the coefficients show a negative correlation and also have a strong correlation against mpg.

Your correlation coefficients are similar to mine.  I found that, for my data, the coefficient of correlation between MPG and WT was -0.8638 and the coefficient between MPG and HP was -0.7758.  I also deduced that the correlation between MPG and WT is strong negative, while the correlation between MPG and HP is moderate negative.  I don't see where you determined the strengths of your correlations but I do not believe -0.7808 is a strong negative.  I think that |-0.80| would be the lower threshold for that.

# Would you recommend this regression model to the car rental company? Why or why not?

The car rental company can use this model to predict the pricing of the rental for a specific car by finding its mpg by using the weight and horsepower of the make and model.

I agree that this model is accurate considering the variables that it accounts for.  If the car rental company is only wanting a price model based on these statistics then I would offer them this model.
