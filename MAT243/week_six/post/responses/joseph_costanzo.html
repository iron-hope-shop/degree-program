        The equation would be:Υ = 36.3348 − 3.7793X1 − 0.0293X2

        The predicted value of MPG for a car of 2,780 lbs and 225 horsepower based on your provided multiple regression model is 19.24 MPG.  The residual if a car with those properties achieved 18 MPG would be -1.24 MPG.  In this scenario, the car achieved 1.24 MPG less than expected.

        The correlation between miles per gallon and horsepower is -0.768119. The correlation between miles per gallon and weight is -0.874573. Both are negative which indicates as miles per gallon increases horsepower and weight decrease and vice versa. The strength of the correlation between miles per gallon and weight is strong because it resides in the range between 0.80 and 1.00. However, the strength of correlation between miles per gallon and horsepower is only moderate because it resides in the range between 0.40 and 0.80.

        Your correlation coefficients about the same values as mine; however, your correlation between MPG and WT was stronger than mine (-0.8638).  I also deduced that the correlation between MPG and WT is strong negative, while the correlation between MPG and HP is moderate negative.

        I would recommend this model to the car rental company as a basis for thier pricing model.  This model is not complete, though, as we determined above there is reason to believe that some customers will get less MPG based on their driving habits.  This model is only a small piece of a bigger picture.
