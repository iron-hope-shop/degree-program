# What does a post-hoc test (like Tukey’s HSD test) contribute after one-way ANOVA is performed?
The boxplot was our post-hoc test of choice.  The purpose of post-hoc tests are to validate the rejection of the null hyptothesis.  They provide another perspective on the data and outline the difference in the means of the data groups.

# Comment on your peers’ results and compare them with your own.
I had the same test statistic value and also rejected the null hypothesis.  I am not able to see your boxplot but in my case the technology ETF has a significantly higher mean than energy and financial.
