        Level of significance was 0.05 and for my dataset the F value = 55.07 and p- value was 0.0. Since the p-value is less the the significance level of 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis. The box plot confirms the rejection of the null hypothesis.

        The boxplot was our post-hoc test of choice.  The purpose of post-hoc tests are to validate the rejection of the null hyptothesis.  They provide another perspective on the data and outline the difference in the means of the data groups.  I had the same test statistic value and also rejected the null hypothesis.  I am not able to see your boxplot but in my case the technology ETF has a significantly higher mean than energy and financial.
