        The level of significance we are asked to use is alpha 0.05

The test statistic is 55.07 and the p-value is 0.0

Since p-value is 0.0 I would rejecy the null hypothesis and say that there is a significant variance in at least one of the ETFs. The box plot I included below does support my conclusion and shows that Technology ETF is higher than either the financial and energy ETF.

        The boxplot was our post-hoc test of choice.  The purpose of post-hoc tests are to validate the rejection of the null hyptothesis.  They provide another perspective on the data and outline the difference in the means of the data groups.  I had the same test statistic value and also rejected the null hypothesis.  I had a similar boxplot which also showed that technology ETF has a significantly higher mean than energy and financial ETFs.
