        Compared to my data's central tendency, your data shows lower figures.  The mean and median are about 10Â°F lower than on my statistics.  From this I can derive you live further north than I do, but not in a tundra.

        In terms of variability, your data has a much lower variance.  The deviation is only slightly lower, though.  This indicates that the temperature in your area was relatively stable with only a couple of freezing or near-freezing days.

        This type of weather may not seem stable but I can confirm that, compared to my data, your weather is fairly consistant.  In my area there is usually no slow shift in the weather pattern.  The temperature is cold during the winter and then one day it will shift from mid 40s to 70s overnight and it will magically be summer (having skipped spring weather).  At least that's how it seems these days.  I am guessing, based on your data, that there will be a transition period between Winter and Spring.
