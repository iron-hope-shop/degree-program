        Compared to my statistics, your temperature has a larger variance and standard devation.  Overall your temperatures are lower, shown by your lower mean and median.  Based on the data the temperature was less than 44Â°F 75% of the time.  Let us not forget that these are the daily HIGHS.  If there was percipitation during the past week, it would have been snow or freezing rain.  This data is meaningful to me in determining I do not what to relocate to that area.  In short: I could not live where you do, it is simply too cold.  I would surely die in that environment.
