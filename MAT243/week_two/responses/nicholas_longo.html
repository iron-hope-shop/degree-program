        My data was skewed right. Most of my frequency landed below the 1,000 TPCP range, up the 38 frequency. Some of my data landed as far out as about 2400, but it was very little. The graph shows an obvious bias towards the lower TPCP ranges.

        Since my data and everyone else's appears to be skewed it is an easy assumption to make; however, it is hard to confirm if your data is skewed, as we do not have the median value for the original population distribution or a visual representation.  It would be most helpful if you included the exported charts in future posts, it makes it a lot easier to respond to your posts.

        This graph has a more normal distribution and shows a much more evenly dispersed collection of data points. These results support the Central Limit Theorem as the data shows us the bell-curve associated with normal distribution, and as such data that closely resembles a stable mean.

        The bell curve is the standard for comparison in this case so if the 1,000 sample distribution is similar then it would indicate that the data is normally distributed.  This would confirm the first part of the central limit theorem (CLT) because our output fits the criteria defined in the CLT.  All samples are identical in size and we still end up with a normal distribution.

        The "grand" mean of these 1,000 samples is 494.32 with a standard deviation of 48.12. The grand mean (494.32) and the overall mean (495.16) are very close. These calculations allow skewed data to be normalized so that probabilities can be drawn from what otherwise might be incomprehensible data points, in the case of outliers or multi-nominal graphs. The Central Limit Theorem helps transform questionable results into normal patterns. This confirms the second part of the Central Limit Theorem. The Standard deviation is relatively low and the two measurements of Mean in the data sets are acceptably close.

        Your grand mean is indeed very close to your original population mean; furthermore, your analysis is very fitting.  The majority of the samples approximating the original data is the foundation of the second part of the CLT.

        I have learned a lot about the fundamentals of sample statistics during this activity, the keystone of which is the central limit theorem.  It allows us to measure the normality of a distribution by comparing it to a gold standard.  After trying the Juypter notebook for myself, I read through other peoples' discussions and it is helpful to see insights such as yours to fill in the gaps of my knowledge.
