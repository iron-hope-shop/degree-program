        Your population is indeed skewed to the right and your distribution of 1,000 appears normally distributed (represents bell curve).  This confirms the first part of the central limit theorem (CLT) because our output fits the criteria defined in the CLT.  All samples are identical in size and we still end up with a normal distribution.

        The grand mean of the 1000 sample means was 492.98 and the S.D. was 46.97. Compared to the original population
        mean of 491.45, it does in fact closely approximate the original distribution mean, and this does confirm the
        second part of the central limit theorem that states that the sample means mean and the original population mean
        should reflect one another.

        Your grand mean closely approximates your population, which confirms the second part of the CLT where it is
        stated that the variance of each sample will closely resemble the original the population divided by each sample
        size.

        Prior to this activity I was not familiar with the central limit theorem.  I have learned what the CLT is and its significance in statistics and probability theory in measuring the distribution of a sample.
