        Since the p-value of my test was higher than the significance value of 0.05 then there is insufficient evidence to suggest rejecting the null hypothesis.

        My conclusion is comparable to yours.  Our p-values were similar and both were greater than the significance level.  Your conclusion is correct.  Based on our readings the proper determination based on these values is that insufficient evidence exists to suggest that population proportions for new and old ball bearings do not meet the required specifications.
