Hi All,

# What type of light would you select to illuminate the different objects in your scene? Why?

- For my scene, I would select a combination of ambient, directional and spotlights. Ambient light will provide a basic level of illumination throughout the scene to simulate the indirect lighting from the environment. Directional light will mimic the sunlight in the image, which creates shadows on the left side of the objects. It would be positioned to match the angle of the incoming light in the photo. Spotlight will be used to replicate the focused and dramatic lighting on the Glow Recipe skincare products.

# How does the texture on the objects influence your decisions? Does the texture affect how the light works? Would you consider altering the texture to something else to illustrate light reflection in a better way?

- The texture of objects in the scene influences how light interacts with them. Textures can have properties like diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and transparency, which affect how light behaves. In my scene, the skincare products have a glossy or reflective texture. To illustrate this better, I would modify the material properties to enhance specular reflection, making the light create more noticeable highlights on the products.

# Where would you position the light? How does that affect your scene?

- The primary light source (directional light) will be positioned to match the angle of the incoming light in the photo, which creates the shadows on the left side of the objects. The spotlight(s) should be positioned to shine directly on the skincare products from the front, just as seen in the image.

# Does your world require more than one source of light?

- Yes. The ambient light provides overall illumination, while the directional light creates shadows, and the spotlights highlight specific objects.

# Would any of your light sources need to have a color applied?

- The ambient light, which provides overall illumination in the scene, can have a neutral or soft white color to simulate natural ambient light. This helps create a consistent and balanced lighting environment. There seems to be a soft pink hue towards the bottom left side, so will need to apply that as well.
