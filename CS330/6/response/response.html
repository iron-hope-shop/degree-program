        I think that the best lighting to use for my image would have to be ambience lighting. The reason for this is because it would help ensure that the scene is lit properly and not to bright from the light sources.

        Your choice of ambient lighting for a uniform illumination is solid, but it might lack the depth and contrast that other types of lighting could provide. Introducing some diffuse lighting could add a natural sense of depth to the scene.

        Due to the fact that not all textures react to lighting the same way, I may need to change the textures of my objects to have the lighting work better.

        It's insightful to consider changing textures to interact better with lighting. Experimenting with different textures, especially in response to diffuse or specular lighting, could yield interesting results and enhance the lighting effects in your scene.

        I think the best place to place the lighting would be from the left due to the fact that when I took the picture I had my window and it is located to the left of my image.

        Positioning the lighting from the left to mimic your window's natural light is practical. It could help maintain the natural lighting effect you're aiming for, especially if you decide to introduce diffuse lighting.

        I think my image will require at least 2 light sources to be able to see the items better depending on the distance between the light source and the objects.

        Having at least two light sources could indeed help in better defining the objects in your scene and creating engaging shadow effects. It's a thoughtful approach to enhancing the visibility and aesthetics of your scene.

        I do not believe that my light sources will need color due to the fact that the lighting used in the image was natural.

        Keeping the lighting color natural suits your scene well. However, exploring subtle color variations, even if just for accent lighting, could set a unique mood or emphasize certain aspects of your scene.
