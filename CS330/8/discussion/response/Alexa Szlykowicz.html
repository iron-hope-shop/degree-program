        Man, your farm scene brings its own unique flavor to the mix. It's cool that you took inspiration from your family's old farm â€“ makes it personal and real. Mixing the yellow and blue light from the poles? Interesting choice. And I totally get the struggles with transparency and creating that starry sky.

        I see you've dived deep into understanding shaders, especially relating to gaming. That SteamDeck reference? Spot on. And yeah, the complexity of meshes can be mind-blowing. The more I work with OpenGL, the more I appreciate what game engines offer. Sometimes it's the story and sentiment behind the scene that matters the most. Keep rocking it!
