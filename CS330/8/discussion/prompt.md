Now it is time to think back to the project you just completed and the cumulative skills you were able to apply in your work. Post an image of your completed 3D scene and describe what you have created. Then, address the following in your initial post:
- What is something new you were able to learn or apply in your project?
- What questions do you still have about computational graphics and visualizations?
- How can you use or expand on these skills in your future educational or professional pathway?

In response to your peers, review the work they have completed and think about the strategies they used in their project. Then, consider the following:
- What do you believe was a particularly successful application of the skills you have learned throughout this course? Why is your peer's use of it unique or well thought out?
- What features did your peers implement in their 3D scenes that you would find interesting or useful to try in your own work? Do you notice any features that are similar to what you used in your own project?
- Considering the introduction to animation you received in a previous module and the more detailed reading in this week's resources, what opportunities do you see to incorporate some of those visualization tactics into your peers' work?
