        The input device I chose is a joystick controller, it would be used for games that use OpenGL primarily. GLFW has joystick functions on their documentation that you can look up, you can use it without adding more libraries to the project. I think some of the challenges would be something that controllers are known for, and that would be having trouble with precise movements such as shooters. Controllers are very accessible, a normal one without any fancy features cost as much as a good mouse, and are pretty portable and small.

        I appreciate your insights on the joystick controller, especially in the context of OpenGL games. The joystick has indeed been a staple in the gaming community for years, and its integration with GLFW certainly makes it a viable option for many developers.

        For the precision issue in shooters, adjustable sensitivity settings might help. Haptic feedback could also aid in accuracy.  An alternative could be the trackball mouse, offering precision but with a learning curve. It might be better for shooters, but less intuitive for fast-paced games.  While joysticks are versatile and accessible, the choice between joystick and trackball depends on the game genre and user preference.
