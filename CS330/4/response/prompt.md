In response to your peers, look at the challenges your classmates noted for using their example input devices. Then, address the following:

- How might you approach solving those challenges?
- Can you think of another input device that would meet the identified requirements? Would this different device have challenges similar to or different from those of the first device? Overall, which do you believe would be better suited for the identified task?

Here is Justin Kaplan's post:

The input device I chose is a joystick controller, it would be used for games that use OpenGL primarily. GLFW has joystick functions on their documentation that you can look up, you can use it without adding more libraries to the project. I think some of the challenges would be something that controllers are known for, and that would be having trouble with precise movements such as shooters. Controllers are very accessible, a normal one without any fancy features cost as much as a good mouse, and are pretty portable and small.
