        My name is Brad, and I'm majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity. I'm 29 years old, happily married, and a proud father of four. Outside of my studies, I work as a senior systems engineer at a large retailer. While my primary interest lies in cybersecurity, I've always been intrigued by the technological advancements in graphics, especially given my role which often intersects with various tech domains.

        Working with OpenGL offers a unique perspective into the world of computing. Even though my professional journey is rooted in cybersecurity, understanding tools like OpenGL can provide insights into system optimization, performance, and the intricate details of how visual elements are rendered.

        For my example, I've chosen the game "Doom 3." This game, while not the newest, was revolutionary in its time for its graphics and lighting effects. "Doom 3" utilized OpenGL to render its 3D graphics and animations, creating a dark, atmospheric environment that added significantly to the game's horror theme. The game primarily used a variant of modern OpenGL, which allowed for the real-time shadows and lighting effects that made it stand out.

        Given the advancements in OpenGL since "Doom 3," I'd be curious to see how newer versions of OpenGL could be optimized for performance and how they could enhance user experience with even more realistic graphics and smoother animations. In a remastered version of the game, integrating these advanced graphics with the game's core mechanics would be an exciting endeavor.

        I'm eager to delve deeper into OpenGL throughout this course and explore its vast capabilities in graphics rendering. I'm looking forward to learning alongside all of you and seeing the diverse applications of this powerful tool!
