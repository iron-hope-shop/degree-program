<p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 48px;">I noticed your query about finding additional resources, specifically videos, for understanding zyBooks topics and the TI CC3220s board in greater detail. I've found YouTube to be an invaluable resource in this regard. Several channels dedicated to electronic and computer engineering cover a wide range of topics, including those relevant to our project. For zyBooks topics, I recommend looking for videos that focus on embedded systems and microcontroller programming. These often provide practical insights that complement what we've learned in zyBooks. As for the TI CC3220s board, Texas Instruments has a channel with tutorials and demonstrations specifically for their products, which I found helpful.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 48px;">Additionally, check out forums and community pages dedicated to TI products. Users often share their projects, which can provide real-world examples of how to implement various functionalities on the TI board. Remember, while these resources are beneficial, cross-reference any information with our course materials to ensure accuracy and relevance to our project. Best of luck with your final preparations!&nbsp;<!-- COPY/PASTA AS NEEDED FOR EACH SOURCE YOU HAVE! --></p>
