        I completely agree with your approach, especially about expecting the project to take more time than initially
        anticipated. It's wise to start early and allocate enough time for troubleshooting and refining your work. Your
        experience with the milestones highlights a crucial aspect of project management: the importance of buffer time.

        Your point about revisiting the Zybook chapters and online forums is also spot on. These resources are
        invaluable for troubleshooting and gaining different perspectives on problem-solving. Additionally, your advice
        about not altering the code after recording the video is crucial. It's a great tip to ensure consistency between
        your submitted work and the demonstration.

        To add to your tips, it might also be beneficial to use version control tools like Git. This way, you can
        experiment with your code without the risk of losing the version that aligns with your video. It allows for more
        freedom in exploring different coding strategies post-submission.

        Best of luck with your project, and thanks for sharing these insightful tips!
