Many organizations now utilize the internet of things (IoT) to allow their business to run more smoothly. According to Margaret Rouse of TechTarget (2020), the use of IoT enables businesses to "monitor their overall business processes, improve the customer experience, save time and money, enhance employee productivity, integrate and adapt business models, make better business decisions, and generate more revenue." For this discussion, you will choose one organization and explain how it utilizes IoT.  
  
In your initial post, address the following:  
- Which organization did you choose? Provide a link to the organization's website, if possible.
- What industry is the organization in (manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, etc.)?
- How does the organization utilize IoT?
- What are the pros and cons of the organization utilizing IoT?  
  
In your responses to at least two peers, compare and contrast how your organization and their organization utilize IoT. Are there common trends among or within industries? Explain. Are there additional pros and cons of the chosen organization utilizing IoT?

IoT in Organizations
For this discussion, I chose Tesla, Inc., which operates in the automotive industry. Tesla is renowned for its innovation in electric vehicles, energy storage, and renewable energy solutions.

Tesla utilizes IoT in several ways, primarily by developing autonomous vehicles. These self-driving cars are a prime example of IoT in action, integrating a multitude of manyces and sensors to navigate safely. Tesla vehicles are equipped with advanced hardware capable of providing an autopilot feature, which is essentially a step towardnomous driving. The data collected from these vehicles is used not only to improve safety and perforto improve safety and performance andaspect of IoT. This predictive maintenance alertan essential vehicle owner and Tesla's support team about potential issues before they become major problems, ensuring the vehicle's longevitsignificant reliability.

The pros of Tesla utilizing IoT include enhanced safety through continuous updates and improvements to their autopilot system, reduced environmental impact due to efficient electric vehicle use, and increased user convenience and comfort. On the flip side, the cons involve concerns over data privacy and security, as  andreliability and safety of autonomous driving technology, which is still evolving. 

Tesla's use of IoT is a testament to the potential this technology holds in transforming the automotive industry and how we perceive transportation and vehicle ownership.

For my discussion post, I chose to look at how Google Nest utilizes IoT. The company is within the smart home technology industry, or also known as the home automation industry (Google). Google Nest specializes in creating innovative products that make homes more connected and efficient. There is further information about Nest on their Google page here (https://nest.com/).

Google Nest utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to develop smart home devices including thermostats, cameras, doorbells, speakers, displays, sensors, and routers (Fingas, 2023). These devices can be controlled remotely via WiFi through a user-friendly app and form a connected network. For example, the smart thermostats use IoT to learn user preferences, and can create a schedule to automatically adjust the temperature settings to optimize both comfort and energy efficiency (Grano, 2021). Homeowners can still override the automatic temperature and manually control the thermostat using the Nest app.

The use of IoT by Google Nest has several advantages, such as making home life more convenient and giving homeowners the ability to monitor and control their home environment from anywhere. However, there are drawbacks like concerns about data privacy and cybersecurity. Some of the devices offered by Google Nest have control over extremely sensitive information or physical security risks including cameras and smart locks. The "Nest x Yale Lock" replaces an existing deadbolt, but is actually considered outdated and not recommended (Fingas, 2023). While all security risks cannot be eliminated using these devices, homeowners should ensure they properly secure their accounts and use updated devices where possible to mitigate these risks.
