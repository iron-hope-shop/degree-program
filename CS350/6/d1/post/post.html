        Tesla utilizes IoT in several ways, primarily through their development of autonomous vehicles. These self-driving cars are a prime example of IoT in action, integrating a multitude of connected devices and sensors to navigate safely. Tesla vehicles are equipped with advanced hardware capable of providing an autopilot feature, which is essentially a step towards fully autonomous driving. The data collected from these vehicles is used not only to improve safety and performance but also to offer predictive maintenance, a key aspect of IoT. This predictive maintenance alerts the vehicle owner and Tesla's support team about potential issues before they become major problems, ensuring the vehicle's longevity and reliability.

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        The pros of Tesla utilizing IoT include enhanced safety through continuous updates and improvements to their autopilot system, reduced environmental impact due to efficient electric vehicle use, and increased convenience and comfort for users. On the flip side, the cons involve concerns over data privacy and security, as well as the reliability and safety of autonomous driving technology, which is still evolving.
