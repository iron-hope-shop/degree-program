        It's great to meet you virtually. I found your perspective on 3D printing particularly intriguing. In my line of work, we often explore similar advanced technologies but primarily from a security standpoint. The concept of 3D printing opens up exciting possibilities but also new challenges in terms of intellectual property and even potential misuse. Have you considered these aspects?

        Your experience with Alexa and the connected doorbell system resonates with me. I too have a home security system, albeit more complex, with facial recognition features. While these devices certainly enhance security, they also raise concerns about data privacy. Your traditional doorbell example made me think: perhaps the simplicity of older systems had some merits in terms of human intuition that we might overlook with the advent of new technology.

        Looking forward to discussing these topics further throughout the course.
