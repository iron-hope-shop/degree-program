        Thank you for bringing up the security perspective.  Embedded systems have often been hidden away and have relied on security through obscurity, which we know is not security at all.  So when these types of devices started to make their way to consumers, security was lacking as you noted.  What special considerations do you think are needed when it comes to security for embedded devices?  Continue to consider security as you navigate the course.  Your training and background in that field can really lend a skeptical eye to these technologies.

        Thank you for your insights. I concur that "security through obscurity" is ineffective. Key considerations for embedded device security would be least-privilege access controls, strong encryption, and real-time monitoring. These elements can significantly mitigate potential risks. I look forward to applying my security-focused lens to the course discussions ahead.
