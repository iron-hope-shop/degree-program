Hey everyone, my name is Brad. I'm actually not a full-time student; I work in Information Security at a big retail company. I started back in 2018 in a pretty basic Server Ops role and moved my way up. I've had my hands on a bunch of different things: Python coding, web app security, and even some automation work using C#, though I'm not a huge fan of the Windows ecosystem, to be honest.

So, when it comes to new tech and systems, I've had some experience, mostly work-related. These days, I'm really into how we can use AI to predict security threats. Also, I've been looking into Rust as a way to make system-level stuff more efficient. It's a learning curve, but pretty cool.

For the embedded systems part of this discussion, let's talk about home security cameras. I've got a set at my place, and they're pretty advanced with facial recognition and all. Sure, they make my home safer, but there's another side to it. These cameras collect a lot of data, and that opens up a can of worms around privacy and ethics. It's like a double-edged sword; we gain some, and we might lose some.

I'm looking forward to hearing what you all think and diving deeper into these topics this semester.
