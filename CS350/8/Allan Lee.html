        Your selection of interview questions effectively emphasizes the importance of reflecting on personal experiences and learnings, especially in an academic setting. Asking about course experience is a great conversation starter, allowing candidates to showcase their journey, skills developed, and professional growth. The question about overcoming course challenges probes into problem-solving skills and adaptability, traits valued in any tech field. Discussing the values gained from the course provides an opportunity for candidates to express their practical and personal achievements, demonstrating self-awareness and goal orientation. Your tips for in-person and online interviews are practical and relevant. The emphasis on comfort and preparation for in-person interviews, and making a strong first impression in online interviews, is crucial advice. The strategy of allocating time for a well-crafted introduction in online interviews sets a positive tone. Additionally, clear and concise communication is essential in both settings, especially when time is limited. Overall, your insights offer a comprehensive approach to interview preparation, blending practical tips with a focus on personal presentation. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and best of luck in your future endeavors!
