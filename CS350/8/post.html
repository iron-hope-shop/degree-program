        For this semester's final discussion post in CS-350-H7050 Emerging Sys Arch & Tech, we're focusing on interview
        preparation, particularly for roles in emerging systems architectures and technologies. Interview success often
        hinges not just on technical know-how but on demonstrating how we handle various situations. Reflecting on my
        six years of experience in the tech industry, I'd like to share insights into tackling some common interview
        questions.

        1. When faced with a difficult problem, how do I solve it?
        In my career, particularly in information security and system architecture, complex problems are a staple. My
        strategy involves breaking down the issue into smaller, more manageable parts. For instance, while leading the
        design and implementation of an onboarding automation system using Java, I approached the project methodically,
        analyzing each component to ensure a secure and efficient process. This experience highlighted my ability to
        combine in-depth analysis with practical problem-solving.

        2. Where do I turn for answers when working on milestones or a final project?
        The source of my solutions varies depending on the project's nature. During my venture into machine learning and
        the development of an internal chatbot, I extensively researched platforms like Hugging Face and engaged with
        online forums and in-house expertise. My approach underscores the importance of leveraging a wide range of
        resources, from academic journals to peer discussions, ensuring that the solutions are well-rounded and
        innovative.

        3. Discussing a project where I was particularly challenged.
        A significant test of my skills occurred in the Operational Excellence team. Tasked with implementing an
        operational change, I encountered a proposed plan that lacked scalability. Advocating for high-quality and
        sustainable solutions, I challenged the status quo and proposed an alternative strategy. This experience was
        pivotal, teaching me the value of ethical standards and the importance of advocating for scalable and efficient
        solutions.

        4. Time allocation for designing, coding, and debugging a project.
        Effective time management is crucial in technology projects. Reflecting on my onboarding automation project, I
        allocated about 30% of the time to designing, ensuring the foundation was robust. Coding comprised 40% of my
        time, reflecting my commitment to creating a versatile and reliable system. The remaining 30% was dedicated to
        debugging and testing, a critical phase to ensure the project's success and long-term viability.

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
        These experiences, combined with my continuous learning in emerging technologies, have shaped my approach to
        problem-solving and project management, skills that are vital in the ever-evolving field of system architecture
        and technology.
