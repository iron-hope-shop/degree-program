        Your comparison between modern and older dryers is an excellent example of embedded systems' evolution. The digital timers in newer dryers offer precise control and energy efficiency, improving over the mechanical methods of older models. However, incorporating moisture sensors could optimize drying times, making these systems more energy-efficient. Additionally, integrating innovative remote control and monitoring technology could enhance user experience and efficiency. It is impressive how such everyday appliances demonstrate the advancements in embedded system technology.
