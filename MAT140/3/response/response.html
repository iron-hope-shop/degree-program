        One of the thing about estimating a value using any mathematical model is that there will almost always be some difference between our expected value and the actual data because life is random.  We obviously don't have data from 2040 yet, but how did your answer in part a compare to the actual data?

        Well if you take the average of the R4000 and Pentium transistor counts (eyeballing it), my answer from Part A was within a couple of million transistors.  Actually my answer was about the same number of transistors as were in the Pentium (~1993).  It also falls within the trendline here (again, eyeballing it) so I would say it is a reasonable guess.
