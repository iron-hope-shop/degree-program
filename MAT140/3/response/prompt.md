I think you are only showing the first part of the problem.  Even though we are not asked for inputs in Mobius (I keep wanting to type Morbius-- LOL) we are supposed to answer those questions here as well.  Your answer looks correct to me!  You should apply that to part B and determine if you think the answer is realistic or not.  Hardware and microprocessor architecture is super interesting!!
