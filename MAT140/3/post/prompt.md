# The number of transistors per IC in 1972 seems to be about 4,000 (a rough estimate by eye). Using this estimate and Moore's Law, what would you predict the number of transistors per IC to be 20 years later, in 1992?

Ni = N0*2^((Yi-Y0)/T)
where N0 is the number of transistors in the reference year Y0, Ni is the number of transistors predicted in the final year Yi, and T is the number of years it takes to double transistors.

N0 = 4000
Yi = 1992
Y0 = 1972
T = 2

Plug in known values and solve for Ni:

Ni = 4000*2^((1992-1972)/2)
Ni = 4000*2^10
Ni = 4096000


# From the chart, estimate (roughly) the number of transistors per IC in 2014. Using your estimate and Moore's Law, what would you predict the number of transistors per IC to be in 2040?

I took an average of the highs and lows during 2014 and came up with an estimate of about 4 billion transistors per IC.

Ni = 4000000000*2^((2040-2014)/2)
Ni = 4000000000*2^13
Ni = 3.2768e+13

Using my estimate and Moore's Law, I predict 3.2768e+13 transistors per IC in 2040.

# Do you think that your prediction in Part b is believable? Why or why not?

I do not believe the prediction in Part b is believable because, even with chip companies printing transistors in layers and new designs they are reaching a physical limit.  I believe that the compute power will be equivalent to this if not more but the transistors will be quantum-based computer architectures or some other, hugely different, architecture.
