A = (2)(pi)(r^2)+(16)(pi)(r)
0 = (2)(pi)(r^2)+(16)(pi)(r) - A

quadratic formula standard form
(a)(x^2) + (b)(x) + c = 0
x = ((-b)+-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a
r = (-(16*pi)+-sqrt((16*pi)^2-4(2*pi)(-A)))/(2)(2*pi)

A(r) = 2*pi*r^2+16*pi*r
A = 2*pi*r^2+16*pi*r
A = 2*pi(r^2+8r)

r^2+8r factors to r(r+8); however, we can complete the square by formatting the equation to the vertex form of the quadratic equation: a(x-h)2+k which is done by adding 16 to both sides and solving for r

(A/(2*pi))+16 = r^2+8r+16
(A/(2*pi))+16 = (r+4)^2
sqrt((A/(2*pi))+16) = r+4
r = -4+sqrt((A/(2*pi))+16)


Part a: Assume that the height of your cylinder is  8  inches. Consider  A  as a function of  r , so we can write that as  A(r)=2πr2+16πr . What is the domain of  A(r) ? In other words, for which values of  r  is  A(r)  defined?

Realistically, r cannot be negative so the domain of A(r) is r >= 0

Part b: Continue to assume that the height of your cylinder is  8  inches. Write the radius  r  as a function of  A . This is the inverse function to  A(r) , i.e., to turn  A  as a function of  r  into  r  as a function of  A .

A(r) = 2*pi*r^2+16*pi*r
A = 2*pi*r^2+16*pi*r
A = 2*pi(r^2+8r)
r^2+8r factors to r(r+8); however, we can complete the square by formatting the equation to the vertex form of the quadratic equation: a(x-h)2+k which is done by adding 16 to both sides and solving for r
(A/(2*pi))+16 = r^2+8r+16
(A/(2*pi))+16 = (r+4)^2
sqrt((A/(2*pi))+16) = r+4
r = -4+sqrt((A/(2*pi))+16)

Part c: If the surface area is  125  square inches, then what is the radius  r ? In other words, evaluate  r(125) . Round your answer to 2 decimal places.
r = -4+sqrt(((125)/(2*pi))+16)
r = 1.99 inches
