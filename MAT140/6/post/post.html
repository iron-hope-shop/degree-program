        <b>Prompt: A Ferris wheel is 25 meters in dimeter and boarded from a platform that is 1 meter above the ground. The six o’clock position on the Ferris wheel is level with the loading platform. The wheel completes 1 full revolution in 8 minutes. The function h(t) gives a person’s height in meters above the ground t minutes after the wheel begins to turn.</b><br><br>

        <b>a. Find the amplitude, midline, and period of h(t).</b><br>
        Amplitude: A = 12.5m<br>
        Explanation: A person who boards the Ferris wheel will travel 12.5m above and below its center.<br><br>

        The midline: h = 13.5m<br>
        Explanation: The Ferris wheel is 1m above the ground and its center is located 12.5m above that.  1+12.5 = 13.5<br><br>

        Period: P = 8 minutes<br>
        Explanation: The Ferris wheel completes 1 full revolution in 8 minutes.<br><br>

        <b>b. Assume that a person has just boarded the Ferris wheel from the platform and that the Ferris wheel starts spinning at time t=0. Find a formula for the height function h(t).</b><br>

        Starting with the negative function suggested in the hints (because the max of -cos(t) is at t=0)<br>
        h(t)): h(t) = -Acos(f(x-h))+k<br>
        where A is amplitude, f is frequency, h is the horizontal shift, and k is the vertical shift.<br><br>

        A = 12.5<br>
        (from above)<br><br>

        To find the frequency we can use the formula f = 2pi/P<br>
        Therefore<br>
        f = pi/4<br><br>

        There is no horizontal/phase shift therefore<br>
        h = 0<br><br>

        The vertical shift is 13.5m since that is the midline height from the ground.<br>
        k = 13.5<br><br>

        Therefore<br>
        h(t) = -12.5cos((pi*t)/4) + 13.5<br><br>

        <b>c. If the Ferris wheel continues to turn, how high off the ground is a person after  20  minutes?</b><br>

        Honestly I just plugged this into a calculator!<br>
        h(20) = 26m
