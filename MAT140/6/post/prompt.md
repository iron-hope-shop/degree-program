a. Find the amplitude, midline, and period of h(t).
Amplitude: A = 12.5m

Explanation: A person who boards the Ferris wheel will travel 12.5m above and below its center.

The midline: h = 13.5m 

Explanation: The Ferris wheel is 1m above the ground and its center is located 12.5m above that.  1+12.5 = 13.5

Period: P = 8 minutes

Explanation: The Ferris wheel completes 1 full revolution in 8 minutes.

b. Assume that a person has just boarded the Ferris wheel from the platform and that the Ferris wheel starts spinning at time t=0. Find a formula for the height function h(t).

Starting with the negative function suggested in the hints (because the max of -cos(t) is at t=0, like h(t)): h(t) = -Acos(f(x-h))+k where A is amplitude, f is frequency, h is the horizontal shift, and k is the vertical shift.

A = 12.5

To find the frequency we can use the formula f = 2pi/P
Therefore
f = pi/4

There is no horizontal/phase shift therefore
h = 0

The vertical shift is 13.5m since that is the midline height from the ground.
k = 13.5

Therefore
h(t) = -12.5cos((pi*t)/4) + 13.5

c. If the Ferris wheel continues to turn, how high off the ground is a person after  20  minutes?

Honestly I just plugged this into a calculator!
h(20) = 26m
