Comment on your classmates' analyses and their answers.
Review the explanation given by your peers for their problem-solving strategies. Your comments may focus on the following:

# How did they describe steps to make their explanation clear?
Great job explaining your work dispite being sort of off your logic was sound.  I like how you included images in your explanation.  I have not had the patience for that but I should really consider it because explaining steps would probably be a lot easier.
# What additional details could they have included?

# What details did they include that you may not have?

# What changes would you make to your initial post?
