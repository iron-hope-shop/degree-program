        Your answers appear to be solved similarly to my own but there is not explanation.  I believe it is for this reason that a couple of your answers seem incorrect.  During this class I have also struggled to add even the most basic steps to show my work.  In your part a, you could include the written out logic behind how you arrived at your answers.  You added hints which I could have added for completeness.  The hints sort of help by adding depth to our answers so I may include them in the future.
