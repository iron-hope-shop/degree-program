        Hello, my name is Brad and I am 27 years old.  I am the proud father of four children and proud husband to a beautiful wife.  I currently work as an Advanced Systems Engineer in Information Security for Walmart Associates, Inc. I am enrolled in the bachelors program for computer science with a focus in cybersecurity. I am lucky to already have a job I would consider to be my dream job; however, in order to progress up the food chain and eventually buy a Ferrari, I have chosen to upskill.

        Math applies to nearly everything I do all day long; however, I have not taken precal since 10th grade so I think this class will be a great refresher.  I am not sure how I would directly apply what we are learning to my work although I am sure I already unknowingly do.  Recently I laid out a plan to shify my career path to more of a focus on data science.  The teachings from this class might just apply to that!

        I did good on the practice exam but the polynomial question got me.  I probably need to revisit that before we dive in too deep!  I think I probably need to set aside some more time as well.  Next time I am also going to use a piece of paper rather than a python interpreter for my work...
