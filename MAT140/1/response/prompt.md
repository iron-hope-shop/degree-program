Congratulations on your baby!  Ours just turned 5mo this past week!  It seems like you already kinda do work in cybersecurity.  I work in cybersecurity for the Walmart Homeoffice!  We have a lot of dealings with the feds and actually have an internationally accredited forensics lab in my building.  I also tend to make silly errors just because of time.  I should probably slow down a bit and not panic about time.  Good luck to you!
