        We just welcomed a new addition to our family and he turned 3 months on the 23rd. I also started a new job working for the IRS which has be quite the experience. This year has been filled with nothing but the firsts. 

My future goal is to work within cyber security. At my current job I am working in identity theft and eventually I hope to transition into a position in IT working for the service.

        Congratulations on your baby!  Ours just turned 5mo this past week!  It seems like you already kinda do work in cybersecurity.  I work in cybersecurity for the Walmart Homeoffice!  We have a lot of dealings with the feds and actually have an internationally accredited forensics lab in my building.  I also tend to make silly errors just because of time.  I should probably slow down a bit and not panic about time.  Good luck to you!
