In responses to your peers, compare the apps you selected and consider the following:

Do you know of a similar app? How do the features compare?
Can you think of a way to improve the interface?
How might the design change if the app were adapted to another device?

The app I chose is Noted. The main purpose of the app is to enhance or in simple words, make it easier to record voice notes, interviews, or lectures. The user can add tags (acting as timestamps) to the important parts while recording which then can be accessed by tapping on the tags.

I am actually impressed by the app's user interface. I think its simplicity is the app's biggest strength, It is simple and minimalistic, easy to navigate and learn which makes the app appealing to users of any demographics in terms of age, and it adapts well to the limited space of the apple watch, as you can easily make voice recordings and take the notes without the need to rely on your mobile devices, which makes the app significantly more accessible while enhancing UX as the elements are relative to the limited space.  The features that stood out the most to me are the text scanning feature, you can also include pictures and edit them in your notes, and most importantly, the tags! This is an app that would actually consider for my personal use for school or work. 

In terms of following guidelines and practices, I have not had the chance to use the app myself, but I believe the app is a good representation of the guidelines and implementation of these practices as the elements are well-distributed and properly aligned, the quality of the images and elements is up to the standards as they are eye-catching and high quality and it seems to follow Apple's minimalist design.

There are several apps that offer similar functionality to Noted, such as Voice Memos and Otter. The features of these apps may differ slightly, but they generally allow users to view voice notes in text form and organize them.

One way to improve the interface of Noted could be to add more customization options for the tags. For example, users could choose different colors or shapes for their tags, or even create their own custom tags. This would make it easier for users to quickly identify the tags they need and make the app feel more personalized.

If Noted were adapted to another device, such as a desktop computer, the design would likely change to better fit the larger screen size. The interface might include more advanced editing tools, make more modifications to the scanned images. It could also include more robust search and organization features to make it easier to find specific notes.  I have to admit I have not had a chance to try this app yet, so it may have even more features I did not include!
