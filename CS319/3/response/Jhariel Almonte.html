        The app I chose is Noted. The main purpose of the app is to enhance or in simple words, make it easier to record voice notes, interviews, or lectures. The user can add tags (acting as timestamps) to the important parts while recording which then can be accessed by tapping on the tags.

        There are several apps that offer similar functionality to Noted, such as Voice Memos and Otter. The features of these apps may differ slightly, but they generally allow users to view voice notes in text form and organize them.

        One way to improve the interface of Noted could be to add more customization options for the tags. For example, users could choose different colors or shapes for their tags, or even create their own custom tags. This would make it easier for users to quickly identify the tags they need and make the app feel more personalized.

        The features that stood out the most to me are the text scanning feature, you can also include pictures and edit them in your notes, and most importantly, the tags! This is an app that would actually consider for my personal use for school or work.

        If Noted were adapted to another device, such as a desktop computer, the design would likely change to better fit the larger screen size. The interface might include more advanced editing tools, make more modifications to the scanned images. It could also include more robust search and organization features to make it easier to find specific notes.  I have to admit I have not had a chance to try this app yet, so it may have even more features I did not include!
