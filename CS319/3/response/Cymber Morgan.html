        The purpose of the Samsung Health app is a health and fitness ap that allows users to take control of their health and have tools in hand to track workouts, steps, activity levels, heart rate and even sleep time. Within this app, you are also able to track caloric intake by providing data of food consumed for the day. The Samsung app shows users their steps, active time, and activity goals that are presented in “activity rings”. With the Samsung Health app, users are able to customize your goals by going into the app and setting them to your fitness goals/needs.

        There are several similar fitness apps available, such as Apple Watch Workouts, Fitbit, and Google Fit. These apps offer similar features such as step tracking, calorie counting, and workout tracking. One way to improve the interface of the Samsung Health app could be to make the icons and buttons more intuitive and easier to understand. For example, the app could use more recognizable symbols for different activities, such as a running shoe for running or a bicycle for cycling. This would help users quickly understand what the app is tracking without having to read the label.

        If the Samsung Health app were adapted to a device it would only really make sense to be on a phone. On a phone device it could display more specific information about the user's activity than it currently does.  For example, the app could display detailed information about the user's heart rate during a workout, or show a map of the user's route during a run or walk. The app could also display more detailed information about the user's sleep patterns, such as the number of times they woke up during the night and the duration of each sleep stage. Overall, the app could provide more detailed information about the user's activity if it were designed primarily for use on a phone.
