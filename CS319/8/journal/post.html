    <h3>What are three (3) things you have learned from your experience with Project Two?</h3>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">

    <ol>
        <li>
            The importance of user research: Through this project, I've learned that understanding the user's needs,
            behaviors, and pain points is crucial in creating a user-centered design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Iterative design process: I've learned that the design process is not linear. It involves creating
            prototypes, testing, getting feedback, and refining the design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Collaboration: I've learned that working with a team, including stakeholders, developers, and other
            designers, is essential for a successful project.
        </li>

    <h3>What are two (2) questions you still have about UI/UX design?</h3>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">


    <ol>
        <li>
            How can we effectively measure the success of a UI/UX design beyond user satisfaction surveys?
        </li>
        <li>
            How can we ensure that our designs are inclusive and accessible to all users, including those with
            disabilities?
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What is one (1) way your earlier questions from Project One were answered?</h3>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">


    <ol>
        <li>
            In Project One, I was unsure about how to balance aesthetics and functionality in a design. Through Project
            Two, I learned that user testing and feedback are key to finding this balance.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What is one (1) way you will apply your learning from Project Two in the future?</h3>
    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">


    <ol>
        <li>
            I plan to apply the iterative design process in future projects. This means I will create prototypes,
            conduct user testing, and refine my designs based on the feedback received. This approach will help ensure
            that the final design truly meets the needs of the users.
