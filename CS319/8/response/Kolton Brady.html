        Hello everyone. The app I have chosen is Lightroom by Adobe. This app allows users to edit images, upload images and follow other users. The app consists of several screens. The first is the Device screen which simply shows users images/files stored on their device.

    <h3>Who is the likely user of the app?</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 48px;">
        Primarily, Adobe Lightroom appeals to photographers and digital artists needing a mobile editing solution. I am a regular user of this app on both mobile (iOS) and PC (mac-OSX). I use it mostly for editing family photos after we have gatherings as well as our family portraits.

    <h3>What is the core objective of the app? Is that clear?</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 48px;">
        The app aims to provide advanced photo editing tools, storage, and a platform for users to learn and share work (Adobe Inc., 2023, Lightroom Photo & Video Editor). This objective is clearly presented.

    <h3>What is the overall app experience like? Is it easy to get started and intuitive to navigate?</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 48px;">
        Overall, Lightroom provides a positive user experience, though its multitude of features may overwhelm newcomers.

    <h3>Do the buttons and other elements add value or are they distracting?</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 48px;">
        Most app elements add value by offering numerous editing options. A more streamlined organization of tools could improve usability. For example, there could be a screen or button for "recently/suggested/commonly used" options for quick edits on mobile. There is an option to save presets and you can save presets based on content other users have shared; however, this is not always clear when you are a new user.

    <p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 48px;">
        In terms of critiques, while Lightroom is feature-rich and well-designed, its complexity could deter beginners. A simplified mode for newcomers could be a beneficial addition.
