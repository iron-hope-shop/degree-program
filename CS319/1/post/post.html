        My name is Bradley Jackson (age 28), my website is brad-jackson.com.  I currently work in InfoSec for Walmart Global Tech.  The textbook for this course is interesting and seems like it has more illustrations than most of the other textbooks we have in this program.  :P   Most of my work revolves around user interactions so with this course I hope to hone my approach when it comes to user-oriented, aesthetically pleasing, and functional design.

        Two products that I love to use in my workspace are my chair and my macbook.
        My chair is great because:
        <ul>
            <li>I can adjust it to my height and can use it with or without a desk.</li>
            <li>It's durable, comfortable, and can support my weight.</li>
            <li>I love the seat and backrest of my chair, they feel so plush and provide a lot of comfort.</li>
            <li>I use it for all sorts of tasks, from work to lounging.</li>
        </ul>

        My macbook is my companion and my go-to for almost everything.
        <ul>
            <li>I use it for everything from work to play.</li>
            <li>I love the design of the macbook, it's sleek and looks really cool.</li>
            <li>I use it to watch movies, play games, and listen to music.</li>
            <li>I love the keyboard on the macbook, it's really comfortable and my fingers don't get sore from typing.</li>
            <li>It's great for schoolwork and projects.</li>
        </ul>

        As far as products I don't use, the app for my oven goes unused; however, we use the oven every day.  The application for the oven is not convenient or available enough for me to want to use it every day.  The app is complex and also slow to connect a lot of the time.  I think if it was less visually busy and a little more responsive, it would be a better experience.  Honestly I would still probably not use it because, again, it is not covenient enough to need to use.  One of us is always home to turn the oven on when it needs to be turned on.

        Another product I don't use that is still in my kitchen is this thing my mother got us that holds apart ziplock bags.  The idea is that it will hold the bag open for you if you need an extra hand.  Again, is this a problem we even needed solved?  We have used it maybe twice in the past year and most certainly could have gone without.

        Evaluating the interfaces of items that we use day-to-day can impact the choices I make as an app designer by forcing me to consider if a product should exist at all and if so what is the perfect state of the product given the ideal user.  It is important to design our products for our customers because without the customers we have no business.
