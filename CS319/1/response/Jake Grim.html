        One product that I don't use that is still in my kitchen is a small oil-based fryer. I no longer use this appliance because while I did enjoy it for a time, it became too tedious to set up and clean after use. I do personally prefer the flavoring of oil-fried food, but the process can be overwhelming when wanting something to eat quickly. Additionally, this appliance doesn't include a timer or a temperature setting, just an on/off switch to get the oil boiling. While this appliance can't be altered in any way to make it work better, there may be some substitutes that could be a solution such as switching it out for an air fryer which takes less time and less clean up while also providing more interface options.

        This is one thing I simply do not like about cooking appliances, especially when I am only wanting to cook for myself.  I think this problem is unsolvable to the oil-based fryer until we have some sort of nanite-based oil that self cleans; however, we may not be frying food at that point.  A more realistic solution is an air fryer.  I have not fried a lot so I am by no means an expert but I will probably continue to go that route (although I am not sure how it really differs from baking since I air fry in the oven).  /rant
