        One product in the Kitchen that I love to use a lot is the microwave. What makes it great is that it’s easy and fast. You just enter the amount of time and hit start. The meal is hot and ready in minutes.

        Microwaves were an excellent invention and are very useful when they are in working condition.  Cooking or re-heating food quickly is a need everyone has at some point (daily). The user interface of microwaves can be improved to make it more user-friendly. For example, the buttons and controls could be labeled more clearly, and the menu options could be organized in a more intuitive way.  Maybe just like the Loupedeck, but less customizability.  I am thinking standard colors/ icons for buttons like the popcorn button.

        Another product I don’t use is an application on my cellphone. The application is called T-Mobile Visual Voicemail. The first issue I had was that the voice to text didn’t get the words right. The issue now is that not too many people leave voicemails anymore. And when you get an alert that you have a voicemail, and you click it. It takes you directly to it. So why would I go to another application to check. Maybe if that application sent it to the app, I use to text maybe it would be useful.

        I do not use visual voicemail either.  It is partly because my voicemail is currently misconfigured due to buying an unlocked phone and swapping in the SIM as opposed to setting it up.  I guess my issue is a different one which could be solved with easier SIM setup (maybe some minor settings carry over with the SIM, etc).  Anyway, I think something which would be useful is consolidating the old "call this number to check voicemail" and visual voicemail to an app or text which screens the call and tells you if it is spam/worth checking your voicemail?  For me the only voicemails I get are from scammers/phishers so when I see that I have 5 messages in voicemail, check them, and they were all robot voices it is endlessly annoying.
