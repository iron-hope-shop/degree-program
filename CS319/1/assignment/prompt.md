As a grower, I want to view a dashboard that informs me of the moisture content and nitrogen level in the soil at each of my trees so that I can easily target water use and track nitrogen levels.

Explain the purpose and goals of the project. Thoughtfully specifying the mobile appâ€™s purpose and goals provides the foundation for the next steps of development in later milestones. Complete a written document that details the application you have selected and describes what the application needs to accomplish for its users. Be sure to do the following:
Describe the app using active verbs that will entice and engage potential customers.
Detail the intent and priorities of the app.


Boost your farm's efficiency with our revolutionary soil moisture monitoring app!  No more guessing at soil moisture levels - get real-time updates on your trees' moisture levels with our app. Track your trees' progress over time with our app, including soil moisture levels, nitrogen levels, and yield. Stay on top of your crops' water and nitrogen management with our app's easy-to-use interface. Get alerts when your soil moisture or nitrogen levels are high or low. Share your data with other growers to stay on track and improve your crops' performance. The purpose of the project is to create a mobile app that allows growers to monitor the moisture content and nitrogen levels in their soil at each of their trees or other kinds of plants.
A similar application is OneSoild Scouting, an application which connects IoT-enabled monitoring hardware with machine learning models to keep track of crops and their health.

OneSoil Scouting (OSS) appears to be geared towards adults, as it is designed to be used by farmers who are responsible for managing their land. The app provides a platform for farmers to monitor their fields to track their crop yields and health, and receive alerts when conditions are favorable for planting or harvesting. In addition to these features, OSS also allows farmers and ranchers to analyze data from onboard computers, such as weather sensors and soil moisture sensors, to monitor the health of their crops. This can help farmers and ranchers make informed decisions about their farming practices and ensure that theircrops are healthy and productive. The app may be more appealing to users who are familiar with agriculture or farming, but it is not specific to any particular culture.

The app's primary purpose is to provide remote monitoring of crop health and yield. OSS's usability and user experience may be limited due to its complexity, as it requires technical knowledge and training. The app may be easy to learn and use, but the lack of customization options and difficulty in tracking data across multiple fields may be challenging. OSS's emotional engagement may be limited due to the monotony of data tracking and lack of personalized features. The app's social engagement may be limited due to the lack of gamification and rewards; however, there is an ability to share data with other users of the application without them having to create an account. OSS is safe to use, as long as you keep your devices updated and have an active internet connection. It is important to always backup your notes before making any changes, as it will help you restore your notes in case something happens.
