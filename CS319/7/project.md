The Kiva borrower's embedded digital wireframe includes a Kiva label at the top of each page for visual consistency. Each page also features back/exit and select labels that correspond to common hardware buttons on flip phones, making it easy to navigate and select menu items. Additionally, borrowers can select any numbered menu item using the corresponding number on their device's keypad, providing multiple options for performing the same action based on their preferences. This design approach simplifies navigation and minimizes hierarchy, allowing borrowers to quickly find the information or function they need.

The platform is designed to be accessible and user-friendly, benefiting borrowers with limited technical knowledge or resources. It provides educational resources and success stories to aid in financial management and entrepreneurship, empowering borrowers to succeed in business and achieve financial goals. Additionally, it offers a simple and convenient loan application process and access to loan information, benefiting those without traditional financial services or struggling with complex systems.

A well-designed platform can streamline the loan application and approval process, benefiting Kiva through increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Moreover, it enables Kiva to gather valuable data on borrower demographics and loan performance, enhancing underwriting and informing future product development.

One innovative solution I developed to adapt to the challenges of creating the borrower-oriented Kiva application for an embedded flip phone system was simplification. By simplifying the user interface and streamlining the application process, I ensured that borrowers with limited technical knowledge could easily navigate and access Kiva's financial support. This approach addressed the challenge of designing for a device with limited capabilities and provided an inclusive experience for all users.

To align the design of the lender cloud application with Kiva's vision and mission, it is important to integrate Kiva's branding elements and messaging throughout the application, emphasizing the social impact and empowerment aspects of lending. Seamless communication between application components can be achieved through secure APIs or web services, ensuring real-time synchronization of borrower loan data and lending opportunities. Optimizing communication is essential by utilizing scalable cloud infrastructure, event-driven architectures, and optimized data storage techniques.

Varied goals of different lenders can be addressed by providing a customizable dashboard for accessing borrower requests, analyzing lending data, and tracking loan repayments. Comprehensive reporting and analytics features enable lenders to assess portfolio performance and make informed lending decisions. Integrating social impact metrics and storytelling elements showcases positive outcomes. Planning and building the lender cloud application involves user research, collaboration with the Kiva team, wireframing, usability testing, and close collaboration with the development team. Continuous monitoring and feedback collection allow for refinements that cater to lenders' evolving needs and align with Kiva's mission of alleviating poverty through lending.
