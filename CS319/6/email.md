Dear Dr. Arisa K. Ude,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding my grades in your UI/UX Design and Development class. As someone who takes pride in my academic performance, I have noticed that my grades in this class have been lower than what I expected.

I understand that you have a specific rubric for grading assignments, and I respect your evaluation of my work. However, I wanted to ask if there is any opportunity for me to improve my standing in the class. I have tried to operate based on the feedback but there always seems be something wrong with my work. I am willing to put in additional effort to improve my understanding and application of the material and any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated.

I understand that there may be nothing that can be done to improve my grade, but I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have for how I can continue to improve my skills in this field.

Thank you for taking the time to read this email, and for your commitment to teaching this class. I hope to hear back from you soon.

Sincerely,

Brad
