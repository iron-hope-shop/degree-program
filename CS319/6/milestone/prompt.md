# Design a UI/UX paper prototype for the main screen of the embedded application

I created a prototype for the main screen of the application from the borrower user's prespective. From top to bottom, the screen has a large label indicating it is the Loan page, with details of the loan below, and a list of contributions from lenders. At the very bottom of the screen are two labelled buttons for viewing the history and the user's account information.

# Explain how users will access the data

As a borrower, the top data priorities for an embedded UI/UX system should include personal information, business information, loan information, and repayment history/status.

Once on the main screen, users can view the details of their currently active loan immediately. A large label denotes the purpose of the screen, below which will be the details of the loan including the loan amount, interest rate, repayment period, and any other relevant information. If they want to view history the can select the history button to view their repayment history and status. The account button will take the users to another screen which displays the personal and business information so the user may edit their details.


# Justify why the design is suited for the user
The design of the embedded UI/UX system is well-suited for the Kiva borrower user because it prioritizes the most important loan information and makes it easy for the borrower to access their repayment history and personal/business information. 

Based on the borrower user story and the range of individual borrower needs explored in the previous milestone, the user would be expected to work through the application in the following order:

1. Turn on their flip-phone and navigate to the application's main screen.
2. View the loan details, including the loan amount, interest rate, repayment period, and loan status.
3. View their repayment history and current repayment status.
4. Access their personal and business information to view and edit their details.

To make this process as intuitive as possible, the design includes specific screen elements such as a large label indicating the purpose of the screen, clear and descriptive labels for each button, and a layout that prioritizes the most important loan information at the top of the screen. The loan data is the most volitile data within the application and may change during the course of a day as lender contribute or the user develops new loan needs.

The loan details and repayment history are brought to the forefront because they are the most important information for the borrower to track their loan payments and manage their loan. By displaying this information prominently on the main screen, the borrower can quickly and easily access the information they need.

Embedded flip-phone systems have limited screen real estate and processing power, which can make it challenging to design a user interface that is both functional and user-friendly. The design of the embedded UI/UX system addresses these challenges by prioritizing the most important loan information and displaying it prominently on the main screen. This makes it easy for the borrower to access the information they need without having to navigate through multiple screens. From my experience, flip phones typically have two option buttons and directional buttons for navigating screens. The position of the history and account label buttons indicate they will correspond to those physical option buttons while the main screen should be scrolled through using the directional hardware buttons.

To complete tasks in the application, the user would simply select the corresponding button on the main screen. For example, to view their repayment history, they would select the history button, and to access their personal and business information, they would select the account button. The design is simple and straightforward, making it easy for the borrower to complete tasks and manage their loan.

# Discuss how you balance creativity with the code of conduct Kiva provides
When designing an application using the Kiva API, designers must balance creativity with Kiva's code of conduct, which provides clear guidelines for responsible and respectful API usage. Designers should consider the impact of their design decisions on users and Kiva. Two list items from the Kiva Code of Conduct that designers should consider are:

1. Respect our users and their dignity
2. Don't misrepresent the data

I avoided disrespectful or offensive design decisions, such as inappropriate language or imagery, and ensured accurate data representation by being mindful of presentation and avoiding misrepresentations based on the data we were provided. By respecting users and ensuring accurate data representation, designers can create engaging experiences while following the Kiva code of conduct. Taking a user-centric approach to design is key, prioritizing their needs and preferences in a respectful and accurate way. Clear and descriptive language and imagery can enhance engagement while maintaining respect. Transparency and openness to feedback from Kiva and users can unlock creative and innovative solutions that meet everyone's needs.
