# Briefly explain the mobile app design option you selected and the users your design serves. You may share your user personas or any of the research you completed that you find most pertinent.
The mobile app design I selected was an app with a dashboard that informed users of the moisture content and nitrogen level in the soil at each of their plants so they could easily target water use and track nitrogen levels.

After speaking with multiple parties it seems like the application should not be completely limited to trees. There is a larger market for tracking this information on plants in general. Here is an example of a persona I created after my initial interviews:
User Persona 1
Name: Sarah Haras
Age: 40
Income: Middle-class
Education: College graduate
Occupation: Accountant

generative AI locally).

Goals and Tasks: Sarah wants to be able to set up reminders for when she needs to water her
plants, so she can stay on top of her watering schedule. She also wants to be alerted when her
garden's health is falling.
Physical Social and Technological Environment: Sarah is a home gardener who is interested in
using technology to improve her gardening experience. Sarah has a beautiful garden that she has
taken great care to maintain. She is interested in using the app to help her water her plants and
monitor the moisture content and nitrogen levels in the soil at her plants. She wants to connect
with other gardeners and share her experiences with them through the app. Sarah works in an
office, but she often has plants at her desk that need watering. She wants to use the app to remind
her to water her plants and set up a watering schedule. Sarah lives in a small apartment, and her
apartment has limited natural light. She wants to use the app to track her plants' health and be
alerted when the moisture content or nitrogen levels are low. She uses a smartphone and tablet
for the app.

Based on feedback on my original screens I modified my wireframe to be a little more user-friendly. Neither one of my participants was able to complete the task of adding new trees/plants or adjusting the
desired watering/nitrogen levels. I have included my original screens below:



# Using Lucidchart, develop a layout of a screen for your digital wireframe that includes at least one navigational element. Post an image of this work along with a description of its features. Note that you may reference the CS 319 Lucidchart Tutorial, linked in this module's Resources section, for guidance on downloading and sharing your work.
I have included a wireframe for new "My Plants" screen of my application. This is the main screen of the application.  On it there are several elements. From top to bottom: On the top is an app bar with the label "My Plants," letting the user know they are in the main screen/dashboard. Also within the app bar are the buttons for creating a new group of trees/plants and accessing the settings screen.  Below the app bar are some scrollable tabs. When clicked, the tab will show the moisture and nitrogen information with respect to the group's name. Below the tabs are the nitrogen/moisture versus time graphs. These will depict measurements of the nitrogen content and moisture at the location of each tree within the group of trees/plants. Each graph has an option button which will allow them to filter the trees/plants shown, edit the data sources, adjust goals, and share/export their readings.
