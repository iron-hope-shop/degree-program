We have an app with a dashboard that informs users of the moisture content and nitrogen
level in the soil at each of their plants so they can easily target water use and track nitrogen
levels.

I created a wireframe of the login screen, my plants dashboard screen, graph options, and the create new group screen. The login screen depicts an image of the logo for our application along with a few simple buttons for users to get logged in.  The "My Plants" dashboard wireframe depicts an appbar at the top of the screen with a label letting the user know which screen they are on.  It also contains a button for viewing the global application settings and a button for adding new groups of plants/trees.  Below the appbar is a tab component with scroll so the user can easily browse and select the group of plants they are wanting to view the details of.  The main function of this screen is to provide a visual for the nitrogen versus time and moisture over time of their plant groups.  Graphs are shown for each set of data along with labels and option buttons for each.  The option buttons lead the user to the third screen, the "Graph Options" screen.  On this screen there are three labels, "Plants to show in graph," "Data," and "Goals."  The user is able to select/filter with plants are included in the output of the graph via checkboxes.  Data can be uploaded/exported via several buttons or the user can opt to manually edit the data.  The user can also view and edit their goals or target levels for the plants.  The navigational component of this screen are the "back" and "save changes" button which will allow the user to decide if they want to keep their changes to the graph.  Back on the "My Plants" screen appbar, when the user interacts with the "New Group" button it will take them to the final screen, "New Group."  Here they are able to enter the metadata for creating a new group of plants including the name and data for the graphs.  When finished, the user has the option to go back to the "My Plants" screen or finalize creating the group.

# Explain the rationale behind your design decisions. In this phase of the mobile app design, you will document the justifications for your design choices in order to communicate to your client how your design was strategic and consistent. Your client may not immediately understand your wireframe by only looking at the screen visuals. You will also need to describe the idea behind each of your screens and your design choices. As you write, consider the following questions:
- What is the purpose and function of each screen in the wireframe?
- How does your design benefit the customer?
- What kind of innovative solutions did you develop to adapt to challenges?
- How did previous research support your decisions?


In designing the wireframe for the mobile app, I considered the purpose and function of each screen to ensure that the user experience is intuitive and efficient. For example, the login screen serves as an entry point for users to access their accounts, and the "My Plants" dashboard screen provides a visual representation of the nitrogen and moisture levels in their plants' soil over time. The graph options screen allows users to customize the data displayed in the graphs and the "New Group" screen enables them to add new groups of plants/trees. My design choices benefit the customer by making it easier for them to track the health of their plants and adjust their watering and fertilization accordingly.

In order to ensure that the user can easily navigate through the app, I developed several innovative solutions to address challenges such as the layout and organization of the screens. Firstly, I used standard UI patterns and design elements to create a consistent and intuitive user experience. One library I am familiar with from work is Material UI (MUI). This library provides a baseline with guidance for user-facing web applications. I borrowed a few ideas from MUI such as the scrollable tabs and appbar (). For example, the use of a tab bar at the top of the "My Plants" dashboard screen allows the user to easily switch between different groups of plants, while the use of a bottom navigation bar on the "Graph Options" screen provides quick access to different screens. Secondly, I created a clear and simple layout for each screen that prioritizes the main function of the screen. For example, on the "My Plants" dashboard screen, the main function is to provide a visual representation of the nitrogen and moisture levels in the user's plants' soil. To achieve this, I used a horizontal layout that allows the user to easily scroll through the different groups of plants and view the data for each one. Lastly, I provided the user with clear and concise instructions and prompts to guide them through the app via help tooltips as suggested by the Apple guidelines (Apple Developer, 2023).

Based on previous research and the feedback from the follow-up interviews, it was clear that there were areas where the mobile app design could be improved to better meet the needs and expectations of the users. I addressed this by improving the navigation and layout of the app to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.

To adapt the wireframe for a digital watch, I would recommend focusing on creating a simple and easy-to-use interface that allows the user to quickly access and view the information they need. This could be achieved by using a clean and minimalistic design with large, clear icons and text.

One of the main challenges when designing for a digital watch is the limited screen size, so it would be important to prioritize the most important information and features and present them in a logical and easy-to-understand order. For example, the watch face could display the current nitrogen and moisture levels for the user's plants, along with any alerts or notifications for when these levels are outside of the optimal range.

In terms of user interaction, a digital watch would likely require a different approach than a mobile app. For example, instead of using touch inputs, the watch would likely use voice commands or physical buttons to interact with the interface. The interface should be designed with these input methods in mind, and the user should be able to quickly and easily access the information and features they need without having to navigate through multiple screens or menus.

In order to adhere to design best practices for wearables, the watch face should be designed to be glanceable and easy to interact with. This could be achieved by using large, clear icons and text and limiting the number of elements on the screen at any one time. The interface should also be designed to be time-saving, allowing the user to quickly and easily access the information they need without having to navigate through multiple screens or menus.

Overall, I would recommend focusing on creating a simple and easy-to-use interface that allows the user to quickly access and view the information they need. This could be achieved by using a clean and minimalistic design with large, clear icons and text, and limiting the number of elements on the screen at any one time. The interface should be designed with the input methods and device limitations in mind, and should be tailored to the specific needs and goals of the user personas.

As a UI/UX developer, I would approach the task of adapting the mobile app wireframe for a touch-based kiosk by focusing on creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate. The screens would be similar but with less personalization options. I can forsee that one of the main challenges when designing a touch-based kiosk is ensuring that the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate for all users, regardless of their familiarity with the technology. To address this, I would use clear and intuitive icons and text to guide users through the process and provide them with the information they need. Additionally, I would include a tutorial or help section to assist users who may be unfamiliar with the technology. To ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience, the kiosk interface should follow the guidelines for navigation, focus selection, and touch screen. This would involve using a clean and minimalistic design with large, clear icons and text, and limiting the number of elements on the screen at any one time. The design should also take into consideration the physical appearance of the kiosk and incorporate it into the application, including consistent color and font use. ATMs provide a good example of a minimalistic and intuitive interface, with a focus on the transaction at hand and clearly-labelled physical hardware. By taking inspiration from this, the kiosk interface could be designed to be similarly minimalistic and focused, with a clear emphasis on the user's goals and a clean, uncluttered design.
