        The design option I selected was to develop an app that can be used by concerned family members of a person with
        dementia that want to be alerted if their relative should walk more than 1,000 steps from home, or leaves their
        stove on for more than 60 minutes. The main purpose of this application is to help ensure the safety of the
        relative by informing family members of hazards that could jeopardize that safety and require a welfare check.
        The application will allow multiple family members to monitor the same relative and provide each family member
        the ability to customize their alerts and notifications.

        Based on the provided description and visuals, the design of the home screen for the app appears to work well in
        serving the needs of its target user group in the following areas:

        The map is the main focus of the screen, and the use of an orange icon to indicate the device location is clear
        and easy to understand. The ability to switch between a street level view and an interior layout of the
        relative's residence using a toggle button is a useful feature that can help users better understand their
        relative's surroundings.

        The inclusion of a blue circle that indicates a boundary or "safe zone" is a useful feature that can help users
        keep track of their relative's whereabouts and ensure that they stay within a designated area.

        The inclusion of a quick 911 call button on the home screen is a useful feature that can help users quickly get
        emergency assistance if needed.

        Overall, the design of the home screen for the app appears to be well-suited to serve the needs of its target
        user group, as it provides a clear and easy-to-use map, includes a boundary or "safe zone" feature, and includes
        a quick 911 call button. These features can help users better understand their surroundings, keep track of their
        relative's whereabouts, and quickly get help if needed.
