        The mobile app I selected is the nitrogen and moisture tracker. The application takes readings from the soil around trees and plants and tracks and graphs the data.

        This is a particularly useful feature, as it allows users to easily see how the levels are changing and make informed decisions about how to care for their plants. The design of the Nitrogen and Moisture Tracker mobile app appears to be well-suited to serve the needs of its target user group. As evidenced by the provided wireframe, the layout is clean and simple, with clear labels and a clear hierarchy of information, making it easy for Mary and other older users to navigate. I think it would be easy for users to get a daily update on their plants, allowing them to keep track of their plants' progress and history. Overall, the design of the Nitrogen and Moisture Tracker app appears to be well-suited to serve the needs of its target user group.
