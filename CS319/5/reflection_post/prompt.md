# Now that you have completed Project One, take a moment to reflect on what you have learned and communicate your thoughts with your peers. This is a great time to share strategies and challenges so you can all continue finding opportunities to improve your design skills. Begin by briefly answering the following:

# What are three (3) things you have learned from your experience with Project One?
Three things I have learned from my experience with Project One are:
1. Designing for the user: I've learned that the key to creating a successful user experience is to put the user at the forefront of the design process. This means understanding their needs and goals, and designing the interface in a way that makes it easy and intuitive for them to use.
2. Iterative design: I've learned that design is not a one-and-done process. It's important to be open to feedback and to iterate on the design, making changes and improvements based on user feedback and testing. This allows for the creation of a design that truly meets the needs of the user and provides a positive user experience.
3. Seeing the forest for the trees: The importance of considering the big picture and overall user journey, rather than just individual screens or elements, in order to create a cohesive and effective user experience.

# What are two (2) questions you still have about UI/UX design?
I am still struggling with the semi-subjective nature of UI/UX design.  It is hard to cast away my bias and break out of the "I know best" mindset. For this reason I still have some questions about UI/UX. Two questions I still have about UI/UX design are:
1. How can I balance the need for a minimal, clean design with the need to provide users with all the necessary information and functionality in the app?

2. How can I ensure that my designs are inclusive and accessible to users with a wide range of abilities, backgrounds, and preferences?

One way I will apply my learning from Project One in the future is by considering the user's needs and preferences in all of my designs. I will use the knowledge I gained about user-centered design and iterative testing to create interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use, while also considering the big picture and overall user journey. This will ensure that the designs I create are effective and meet the needs of the user, which will ultimately lead to a better user experience.
