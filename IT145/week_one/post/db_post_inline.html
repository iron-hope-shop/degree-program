        Hello, my name is Brad.  I am the proud father of three children and proud husband to a beautiful wife.  I currently work as a Systems Engineer in Information Security for Walmart Associates, Inc. I am enrolled in the bachelors program for computer science with a focus in cybersecurity. I am lucky to already have a job I would consider to be my dream job; however, in order to progress up the food chain and eventually buy a Ferrari, I have chosen to upskill.

        The person who influenced the pursuit of my degree was a family friend. She helped me get my first role with my current employer and has been a great mentor. My comfort level with programming is, "If you got a problem, yo I'll solve it."

        I am confident in my ability to use Spring Boot Java but when it comes to Java without a framework, I am only moderately experienced. I appreciate the opportunity to learn job-related skills and I know it will probably humble me.

        Life is pretty hectic, having children, a wife, and a full time job. I am sure I am not the only one enrolled in this course who can relate to having a full schedule. Planning certain days to wake up early and do my studies is pretty crucial but I mostly just work on homework when I can and it seems to have worked well so far!

        Regarding the material in Module One: So far we are just doing an overview of Java and I can not think of anything I am hung up on.
