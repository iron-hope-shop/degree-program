        My program is Game Programming and Development. Since I was a kid I always wanted to work in the video game industry and my aspirations are to make a career as a game developer focus on programming and modeling. Something that really influenced me into the video game industry was pretty much the curiosity on how video games were made, when I was a kid I always remembered that I was thinking how video games were made and how did they make it so fun for everyone.

        That is awesome! One of my best friends from childhood actually went down that path and he seems to love what he does. On the other hand, I am horrible at modeling and I absolutely dread it; however, I admire anyone with the skill to do it. It definately takes talent and know-how.

        I feel really comfortable with learning programming but I still feel pretty new to it, so I will say my level is a beginner but willing to learn everything I can. The skill I really need to improve I would say is time management and patience.

        Great mindset, I feel the same way! There's so much to know and the field is so exciting so it's easy to get overwhelmed a lot. Staggering is key to prevent burnout for sure.
