        The most interesting thing I learned in the modules was about the <i><b>@return</b></i> and <i><b>@see</b></i> Javadoc comments.  I have never these comments before and am excited to try this new (to me) feature.

        I am excited to learn more about graphics within Java.  I realize those are supplimentary sections that we are not required to read but I have done a lot of experimenting the past few days with Javascript canvas. I'm trying to get a head start and brushing up for a project for work.  Sections 8.13 to 8.14 detail pretty much what I have taught myself in JS.  I was just thinking today that I should delve into 2D graphics in Java as well.
