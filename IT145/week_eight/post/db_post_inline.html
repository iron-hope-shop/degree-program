         Often internal software projects are passed to a new wave of engineers.  Recently I inherited a Ruby web app from a senior engineer.  It is a simple static website but I resent the fact that I have no sort of environment set up for such a project nor do I have a template.  Or do I?  Along with the website I was provided a docker image which, when ran with a few arguments to map the ports and a few other intricacies, basically contains everything I need to do local development on the project.  No need for downloading the latest version of Ruby nor setting up environment variables-- even packages are imported during the runtime of the docker container.

         It is for this reason that I chose to write about Gitpod.  "Gitpod [is] the first open source developer platform to automate the provisioning of ready-to-code development environments" (Schalm, 2020).  It is an exciting to know that the future of "ok, let's set you up to get going on this project" will be, "here's the link to your container."  I have personally experienced developers wanting to use different IDEs and struggling to set up environments in order to onboard to new projects.  Honestly, containerization alone simplifies this issue; however, Gitpod takes containerizing a local development environment to a whole new level by wrapping everything from version-controlled source code to IDE in a container:<br>

         Gitpod has large impacts on society.  The speed with which development can currently be done in easily-read languages such as Python is unreal.  Projects can virtually be written as they are spoken and Gitpod can be used this further by providing a unified environment for an entire devops team.  The result is that in times such as these we can go from idea to production-ready in shorter sprints.  One example that I will not elaborate too much on is COVID-19 preparedness.  The availability of numbers can save lives these days.  It is for this reason that Gitpod can indirectly contribute to "human well-being" (Gotterbarn, 2018).

    <p style="text-indent:48px;line-height:2">
         I think the main concern of mine regarding avoiding harm is that Gitpod will have to be sure to have availability for their end users.  It is a risk to use a remote platform for core development due to downtime risks.  Despite what you may have heard, 100% uptime is unachieveable in practice.  It is not clear if Gitpod offers local solutions in event of downtime but that would be my main concern.
